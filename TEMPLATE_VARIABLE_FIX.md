# Template Variable Fix Applied

## 🐛 Issue Found
The V2 registration template was referencing `context.is_team_event` and `context.user_team`, but the view was passing these as top-level variables `is_team_event` and `user_team`.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Template Variable References (registration_v2.html)
**Changed all occurrences:**
- `context.is_team_event` → `is_team_event`
- `context.user_team` → `user_team`

**Affected lines (~20 references):**
- Line 28: Meta chip for team/solo indicator
- Line 67-74: Step 1 title and description
- Line 84: Team selection card conditional
- Line 120: Captain's game information label
- Line 132: Save to profile checkbox (solo only)
- Line 163: Next button text
- Line 170: Step 2 (roster) conditional
- Line 236: Review step number calculation
- Line 252, 279, 303: Review section conditionals
- Line 332: Payment step number calculation
- Line 388: JavaScript context `isTeam` value
- Lines 393-396: JavaScript context team data

### 2. View Game Field Fix (registration_modern.py)
**Changed:**
```python
# BEFORE (checking for .code attribute that doesn't exist)
"game": tournament.game.code if hasattr(tournament.game, 'code') else str(tournament.game),

# AFTER (tournament.game is already a string)
"game": str(tournament.game),
```

## 🎯 Impact

Now the template will correctly:
- ✅ Show "Team Tournament" chip for team events
- ✅ Display team selection dropdown for team tournaments
- ✅ Show "Captain's Game Information" for team events
- ✅ Include roster step (Step 2) for team tournaments
- ✅ Calculate correct step numbers (3 steps for team, 2 for solo)
- ✅ Pass correct `isTeam` value to JavaScript
- ✅ Pass team data (id, name, tag, logo) to JavaScript

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Team Tournament (VALORANT)

### Test 2: Solo Tournament (eFootball)
**URL:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/tournaments/t/test-efootball-tournament/
**Expected:**

- ✅ Shows "Player Information"
- ✅ Has 2 steps: PLAYER INFO → REVIEW
- ✅ No roster step
