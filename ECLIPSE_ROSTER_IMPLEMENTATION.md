## Dynamic Behavior

### Content Adaptation
The card intelligently shows different sections based on the member's role:

1. **OWNER/MANAGER/COACH**: 
   - Shows only team role badge
   - NO in-game details section
   - Focus on administrative role

2. **PLAYER/SUBSTITUTE**:
   - Shows team role badge
   - Shows in-game details section with:
     - IGN/Game ID (if member has permission to view)
     - In-Game Role (Duelist, Support, etc.)
     - Server ID (for applicable games)

### Permission-Based Display
- **Team Members**: See full game IDs and in-game roles
- **Public Viewers**: See roles but not personal game IDs
- **Owner**: Appears in active roster, can assign game roles

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **CSS Containment**: Cards use `overflow: hidden` for paint optimization
2. **Hardware Acceleration**: Transforms use `translate3d` when possible
3. **Lazy Loading**: Avatar images use `loading="lazy"`
4. **Efficient Selectors**: Class-based selectors, no deep nesting
5. **Minimal Reflows**: Changes trigger GPU-accelerated properties

### Load Times
- **CSS**: ~15KB compressed
- **JavaScript**: ~8KB compressed
- **Fonts**: Loaded asynchronously via Google Fonts
- **Images**: Lazy-loaded avatars
