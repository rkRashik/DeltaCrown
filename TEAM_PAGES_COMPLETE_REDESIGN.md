# Team Pages Complete Redesign & Polish - Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Team Hub Page - Hero Section** ✅
**Problem**: Game icon bubbles were floating in the hero section, cluttering the interface.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `.floating-games` container and all floating game icon elements from the hero section
- Hidden floating game icons via CSS (`display: none`)
- Kept projectile animations for visual interest without cluttering
- Result: Clean, professional hero section with stats and CTAs

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/teams/list.html` - Removed floating game icons HTML
- `static/siteui/css/teams-list-two-column.css` - Hidden floating icons via CSS

---

### 2. **Team List View - Alignment Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Teams in list view were not properly aligned and positioned.

**Solution**:
- Improved flexbox layout with better spacing
- Set proper flex properties: `flex: 1 1 auto` for header, `flex: 0 1 auto` for stats
- Added consistent gaps (`gap: var(--space-4)`)
- Increased min-height to 90px for better visual consistency
- Fixed team header max-width (50%) to prevent overflow
- Stats now have `margin-left: auto` for proper right alignment
- Increased stat item padding and min-width (70px) for readability

**Changes**:
```css
.view-list .team-card {
  min-height: 90px;
  gap: var(--space-4);
  padding: var(--space-4) var(--space-5);
}

.view-list .team-header {
  max-width: 50%;
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}

.view-list .team-stats {
  margin-left: auto;
  flex: 0 1 auto;
}
```

---

### 3. **Filter by Game - Dropdown Overlap** ✅
**Problem**: Dropdown was overlapping content below and not properly visible.

**Solution**:
- Added `position: relative` and `z-index: 10` to `.game-filters`
- Increased max-height from 800px to 1200px for better accommodation
- Ensured proper overflow visibility with `overflow: visible`
- Dropdown now properly floats above other content

**CSS Fix**:
```css
.game-filters {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  overflow: visible;
}

.game-filters.expanded {
  max-height: 1200px;
}
```

### 4. **Game Filters - Removed Games** ✅
**Problem**: Call of Duty: Mobile, League of Legends, and Dota 2 needed to be removed from filters.

**Solution**:
- Commented out CODM, LOL, and DOTA2 from `apps/common/game_assets.py`
- Games are preserved as comments for easy re-activation if needed
- All games can be re-enabled by uncommenting the code

**Games Removed**:
- ❌ Call of Duty: Mobile (CODM)
