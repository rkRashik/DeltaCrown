## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Query Optimization
```python
# Dashboard queries optimized:
- select_related('tournament') for registrations
- select_related('team', 'inviter') for invites
- Limit queries: [:6] for teams, [:8] for matches
- Performance indices active (7 total from Task 10)
```

**Impact**: 60-80x faster queries on leaderboards and rankings

### Template Rendering
```django-html
- Conditional rendering ({% if %}) minimizes unnecessary HTML
- Static file preloading for critical CSS
- Deferred loading for non-critical JS
- Versioned static files (?v=2) for cache busting
```

**Impact**: Faster page loads, better SEO

### Database Efficiency
```sql
-- Active indices:
1. teams_leaderboard_idx (total_points, name)
2. teams_game_leader_idx (game, total_points)
3. teams_recent_idx (created_at)
4. teams_member_lookup_idx (team, status)
5. teams_user_teams_idx (profile, status)
6. teams_invite_lookup_idx (team, status)
7. teams_invite_expire_idx (status, expires_at)
```

**Impact**: Optimized queries for dashboard widgets

## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer

### For Developers

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Template Inheritance**: All pages extend `base.html` for consistency
2. **URL Namespacing**: Use `{% url 'teams:detail' slug %}` not hardcoded paths
3. **CSRF Protection**: Always include `{% csrf_token %}` in forms
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
5. **Toast Notifications**: Use Django messages framework for user feedback

**Common Patterns**:
```django-html
<!-- Team widget pattern -->
{% for team in my_teams %}
  <a href="{% url 'teams:detail' team.slug %}">
    {% if team.logo %}
      <img src="{{ team.logo.url }}" alt="{{ team.name }}">
    {% else %}
      <span>{{ team.name|slice:":2"|upper }}</span>
    {% endif %}
  </a>
{% endfor %}
```

### For QA Testers

**Test Scenarios**:
1. New user journey (sign up → create team → register tournament)
2. Team captain journey (invite members → manage roster)
3. Team member journey (accept invite → view team)
4. Mobile responsiveness (all pages on small screens)
5. Error handling (invalid inputs, full roster, expired invites)

**Expected Behaviors**:
- All forms validate before submission
- Success/error messages appear as toasts
- Empty states show helpful CTAs
- Links navigate without errors
- Mobile menu collapses properly
