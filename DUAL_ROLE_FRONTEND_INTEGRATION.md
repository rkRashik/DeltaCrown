# Dual-Role System Frontend Integration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the integration of the dual-role system across all frontend components of the teams app.

## Completed âœ…

### 1. API Layer (100% Complete)
**Files Updated:**
- `apps/teams/api_views.py`

**Changes:**
- âœ… Added `player_role` field to `get_roster()` function (line ~704)
- âœ… Added `player_role` field to `get_roster_with_game_ids()` function (line ~803)
- âœ… Added `player_role` field to game-specific roster queries (line ~692)

**Result:** All roster API endpoints now return player_role data

### 2. Team Roster Tab (100% Complete)
**Files Updated:**
- `static/js/team-detail/tabs/roster-tab.js`
- `static/css/team-detail/roster-dual-role.css`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Dual-role badge display (membership role + player role)
- âœ… Color-coded player roles (red for entry fragger, gold for IGL, green for support, etc.)
- âœ… Responsive design with hover effects
- âœ… `getPlayerRoleColor()` function for tactical role mapping
- âœ… Full integration with roster API data

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.roster-player-role-badge`
- `.roster-roles-section`
- Color system for all tactical roles

### 3. Team Settings Page (100% Complete)
**Files Updated:**
- `templates/teams/settings_enhanced.html`
- `apps/teams/views/public.py`
- `apps/teams/urls.py`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Display player role alongside membership role
- âœ… Player role dropdown for captains to edit roles
- âœ… Template tag integration (`{% load dual_role_tags %}`)
- âœ… Dynamic role options based on team's game
- âœ… AJAX endpoint for changing player roles
- âœ… JavaScript function `changePlayerRole()`

**New Backend Endpoint:**
- URL: `/<slug>/change-player-role/`
- View: `change_player_role_view()`
- Method: POST (JSON)
- Payload: `{profile_id: int, player_role: string}`

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### 4. Team Cards (50% Complete - Skipped for now)
**Files to Update:**
- `templates/teams/team_card.html` (or similar component)
- `templates/teams/partials/*.html`

**Required Changes:**
- [ ] Add player role display to team member cards
- [ ] Update card templates to show dual roles
- [ ] Apply consistent styling with roster badges

**Locations to Check:**
- Team list page cards
- Team detail page member cards
- Dashboard team cards
- Search results team cards

**Note:** Team cards in hub.html have formatting issues. Will address in separate refactor.

## Completed âœ… (Continued)

### 5. Tournament Registration (100% Complete)
**Files Updated:**
- `apps/tournaments/views/registration_modern.py`
- `static/js/registration-v2.js`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Added `player_role` to roster data in registration view (line ~100)
- âœ… Updated JavaScript to auto-fill player roles from team roster
- âœ… Modified `addPlayerCard()` to use `player_role` from dual-role system
- âœ… Changed role dropdown label to "Player Role" for clarity
- âœ… Added visual indicator for auto-filled roles ("Auto-filled from team roster")
- âœ… Prioritizes `player_role` over membership `role` for tactical roles

**How It Works:**
1. When captain registers team for tournament, backend loads team roster
2. Roster includes each member's `player_role` (tactical role)
3. JavaScript auto-fills player cards with all roster data including `player_role`
4. Role dropdown is pre-populated with their tactical role
5. Captain can override if needed
6. Visual feedback shows which fields were auto-filled

## Technical Details

### Dual-Role System Architecture

**Model:**
```python
# apps/teams/models/_legacy.py
class TeamMembership(models.Model):
    player_role = models.CharField(
        max_length=50, 
        blank=True, 
        null=True,
        help_text="In-game tactical role (e.g., Duelist, Entry Fragger, IGL)"
    )
```

**Utilities Available:**
```python
# apps/teams/dual_role_system.py
from apps.teams.dual_role_system import (
    get_player_roles_for_game,        # Get available roles for a game
    validate_player_role_for_game,    # Validate role is valid for game
    get_role_badge_color,             # Get color for role badge
    validate_roster_composition,      # Validate team composition
    serialize_roster_with_roles,      # Serialize roster data
)
```

**Template Tags:**
```django
{% load dual_role_tags %}
{% get_player_roles team.game as player_roles %}
{% for role in player_roles %}
    <option value="{{ role }}">{{ role }}</option>
{% endfor %}
```

|-----------|-------|----------|
| Aggressive/Entry | Red (#ef4444) | Entry Fragger, Duelist |

| Support | Green (#10b981) | Support, Healer |
| Flex/Utility | Purple (#a855f7) | Flex, Controller |

| AWPer/Sniper | Orange (#f97316) | AWPer, Sniper |
| Lurker/Flanker | Indigo (#6366f1) | Lurker, Flanker |
