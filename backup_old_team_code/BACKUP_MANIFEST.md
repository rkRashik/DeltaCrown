## üö´ DO NOT DELETE

The following files must remain for backward compatibility:
1. `_legacy.py` - Core models still in active use
2. Migrations 0001-0017 - Required for database schema
3. `LegacyTeamStats` - Kept for API compatibility

---

## üìù Notes

**Legacy Code Strategy:**
- `_legacy.py` is not truly "legacy" - it's the active implementation
- Name is historical; code is production-ready
- Modern modules import from `_legacy.py` for stability
- No actual deprecated code found requiring backup

**Conclusion:**
- No code needs to be moved to backup at this time
- All "legacy" references are to maintained, production code
- Focus cleanup efforts on TODO resolution and optimization
