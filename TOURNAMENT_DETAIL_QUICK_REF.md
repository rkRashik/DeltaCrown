# Tournament Detail Page - Quick Reference Card

## ✅ What Was Fixed

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Registration Button** | Used `tournament.status == 'REGISTRATION'` | Uses `{% if can_register %}` from backend |
| **Registration URL** | Hardcoded URL template tag | Uses `{{ register_url }}` from backend |
| **War Room Access** | Broken conditional logic | Uses `{% if user_registration %}` properly |
| **Capacity Display** | Not shown | Shows `{{ capacity_info.filled_slots }}/{{ capacity_info.total_slots }}` |
| **Prizes** | Hardcoded fake amounts | Iterates `{% for prize in prize_distribution %}` |
| **Banner/Poster** | May not display | Uses `media_data.banner` and `media_data.thumbnail` |
| **Participants** | Unclear if real | Properly loops through `participants` list |
| **Stats** | Wrong variable (`teams_count`) | Uses `{{ stats.total_participants }}` |
