# DeltaCrown Esports Platform - A Complete Guide

**Written on:** December 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** Understanding how the DeltaCrown platform works for users, teams, and tournaments

---

## Welcome to DeltaCrown

Imagine a place where gamers from Bangladesh and South Asia come together to compete, form teams, and participate in professional esports tournaments. That's DeltaCrown. It's not just a website – it's a complete ecosystem where a casual player can sign up today and potentially compete in major tournaments tomorrow.

This platform supports many popular games: Valorant, PUBG Mobile, Free Fire, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, eFootball, Dota 2, CS2, Call of Duty Mobile, and more. Each game has its own community, teams, and tournaments.

Let's walk through this platform step by step, understanding how everything works from a user's perspective.

---

## Part 1: The Journey of a User

### How Someone Becomes a User

Picture this: A 19-year-old gamer named Mahir from Dhaka loves playing Valorant. He hears about DeltaCrown from his friends and wants to join. Here's what happens:

**Step 1: Creating an Account**

Mahir visits the DeltaCrown website and clicks "Sign Up". The platform asks him for basic information:
- A username (this will be his identity on the platform, like "mahir_bd")
- An email address (this is very important and must be real)
- A password (to keep his account secure)

Unlike many websites, DeltaCrown requires a real email address. Why? Because esports involves real competitions with real prizes. The platform needs to verify that Mahir is a real person.

**Step 2: Email Verification**

After Mahir submits his information, he doesn't get instant access. Instead, DeltaCrown sends a verification code to his email. This code is a special number that proves Mahir owns that email address. He must enter this code on the website to activate his account.

This verification process is crucial because:
- It prevents fake accounts
- It ensures tournament organizers can contact participants
- It's needed for prize distribution later

Once Mahir enters the correct code, his account becomes "verified" and he can fully use the platform.

### Building Your Profile - The Heart of Your Identity

After verification, Mahir has a basic account, but it's empty. Now comes the important part: building his profile. Think of the profile as Mahir's esports resume – it tells everyone who he is, what games he plays, and how good he is.

**Personal Information Section**

First, Mahir fills in who he really is:
- **Display Name**: This is what other players see. Mahir chooses "MahirGG" as his display name
- **Real Full Name**: His actual legal name is "Mahir Rahman". This is kept private and only used for official purposes like prize claims
- **Date of Birth**: Mahir enters his birthday. The platform requires users to be at least 13 years old for esports competitions
- **Profile Picture (Avatar)**: Mahir uploads a cool gaming-themed image
- **Banner Image**: A large image that appears at the top of his profile page
- **Bio**: A short description where Mahir writes: "Competitive Valorant player from Dhaka. Duelist main. Looking for a serious team to grind with."

**Location Information**

DeltaCrown needs to know where Mahir is from because:
- Many tournaments are region-specific (Bangladesh only, South Asia, etc.)
- Prize shipping requires accurate addresses
- Regional leaderboards group players by location

Mahir fills in:
- **Country**: Bangladesh
- **Region**: BD (Bangladesh region code)
- **City**: Dhaka
- **Postal Code**: His area postal code
- **Full Address**: His complete address (kept private, used only for prizes)

**Contact Information**

- **Phone Number**: Mahir's mobile number (kept private unless he chooses to show it)
- **Emergency Contact**: The platform asks for an emergency contact person's name, phone, and relationship (like "Father" or "Sister"). This is important for LAN events or if something urgent happens

**Game Identities - The Most Important Part**

Here's where Mahir tells DeltaCrown which games he plays and his player IDs in those games. This is crucial because when he joins a team or registers for a tournament, the platform needs to know his in-game identity.

For each game, there are specific ID fields:

**Valorant Players:**
- **Riot ID**: This is the username shown in Valorant, like "MahirGG#BD01"
- **Riot Tagline**: Just the tag part, like "BD01"

**PUBG Mobile Players:**
- **PUBG Mobile ID**: The numeric or alphanumeric ID in the game
- **Character Name**: What the player is called in PUBG Mobile

**Mobile Legends Players:**
- **MLBB ID**: The Mobile Legends player ID
- **MLBB Server ID**: Which server they play on (often numbered like 9143 for Bangladesh)

**Free Fire Players:**
- **Free Fire ID**: The unique Free Fire player identification

**CS2 and Dota 2 Players:**
- **Steam ID**: The Steam account identifier (a long number or custom URL)

**eFootball Players:**
- **eFootball ID**: Player identification in eFootball

**Call of Duty Mobile Players:**
- **CODM UID**: The unique identifier in Call of Duty Mobile

**FC 24 (FIFA) Players:**
- **EA ID**: Electronic Arts account ID

Mahir plays Valorant, so he fills in his Riot ID as "MahirGG#BD01". If he also played PUBG Mobile, he could fill in that ID too. The platform allows players to have identities across multiple games.

**Social Media Connections**

Gamers today are also content creators and streamers. The platform lets Mahir connect his social accounts:
- **Discord ID**: Like "mahir#7890" (very important for team communication)
- **YouTube Channel**: If he uploads gameplay videos
- **Twitch Channel**: If he streams
- **Twitter/X Account**: For updates and following esports news
- **Facebook Gaming**: Popular in Bangladesh
- **Instagram**: Personal photos and team moments
- **TikTok**: Short gaming clips

Mahir adds his Discord because teams use it for voice communication during matches. He also adds his YouTube channel where he uploads Valorant highlights.

**Competitive Statistics**

The platform tracks Mahir's performance and participation:
- **Skill Rating**: Starts at 1000 points. Goes up when he wins tournaments, goes down if he performs poorly. Think of it like an MMR (Match Making Rating)
- **Reputation Score**: Starts at 100. This measures fair play and sportsmanship. If Mahir is reported for toxic behavior, it drops. If he's a good teammate, it increases
- **Level**: Starts at 1. Increases as he participates more on the platform (joining teams, completing tournaments, posting content)
- **Experience Points (XP)**: Starts at 0. Earned through various activities

**Gamification Features**

To make the platform fun and engaging:
- **Badges**: Special achievements like "First Tournament Win", "100 Matches Played", "Verified Player"
- **Pinned Badges**: Mahir can select up to 5 favorite badges to display prominently on his profile
- **Inventory Items**: Digital collectibles earned or purchased

**Economy - The DeltaCoin System**

DeltaCrown has its own virtual currency called "DeltaCoin". Think of it like tokens in an arcade:
- **DeltaCoin Balance**: How many coins Mahir currently has
- **Lifetime Earnings**: Total money Mahir has won from tournaments (in real currency like Bangladeshi Taka)

Mahir can earn DeltaCoin by:
- Winning tournaments (prize distribution)
- Daily login rewards
- Completing achievements
- Referring friends to the platform

He can spend DeltaCoin on:
- Tournament entry fees (some tournaments accept DeltaCoin instead of real money)
- Cosmetic items for his profile
- Premium features

**Privacy Settings - Who Can See What**

Mahir has full control over his privacy. For each piece of information, he can decide if it's public or private:
- **Make Profile Private**: If enabled, only approved friends can see his full profile
- **Show Email**: Usually kept OFF (private)
- **Show Phone**: Usually kept OFF (private)
- **Show Social Links**: Usually ON so teams can find him
- **Show Address**: Usually OFF (only revealed when claiming prizes)
- **Show Age**: Usually ON (teams want to know if you're old enough)
- **Show Real Name**: Usually OFF (he goes by "MahirGG", not "Mahir Rahman")
- **Show Country**: Usually ON (teams want regional players)

Mahir keeps most things private except his gaming information and social links. He wants teams to find him, but doesn't want strangers knowing his home address.

**KYC - Identity Verification for Big Prizes**

KYC stands for "Know Your Customer". When Mahir wins a tournament with a significant prize (like 5,000 Taka or more), the platform needs to verify his real identity to legally transfer the money.

The KYC process involves:
1. Mahir uploads a photo of his National ID card or Passport
2. Platform staff verify the document
3. His profile gets marked as "KYC Verified"
4. Now he can claim prizes without delays

KYC Status can be:
- **Unverified**: Just signed up, no documents submitted
- **Pending**: Documents submitted, waiting for review
- **Verified**: Identity confirmed, can claim prizes
- **Rejected**: Documents were invalid, need to resubmit

### What Can a User Do on the Platform?

Now that Mahir has a complete profile, here's everything he can do:

1. **Browse Tournaments**: See all upcoming competitions across all games
2. **Create a Team**: Start his own Valorant team if he has friends
3. **Join a Team**: Apply to existing teams that are recruiting
4. **Register for Solo Tournaments**: Enter 1v1 competitions alone
5. **Register for Team Tournaments**: If he's on a team, enter 5v5 competitions
6. **Follow Other Players**: Keep track of friends and rivals
7. **Follow Teams**: Support his favorite esports organizations
8. **Post Content**: Share updates, screenshots, tournament results
9. **Earn Badges**: Complete achievements
10. **Climb Leaderboards**: Compete to be the top-ranked player in his game/region
11. **Watch Streams**: Follow live tournament broadcasts
12. **Claim Prizes**: Receive winnings from tournaments

## Part 2: The World of Teams

### Understanding Teams in DeltaCrown

Let's say Mahir has been playing solo for a while and now wants to join the competitive scene seriously. He realizes that most major tournaments are team-based. In Valorant, you need 5 players. In PUBG Mobile, you need 4 players. In Mobile Legends, you need 5 players.

This is where teams come in.

A team in DeltaCrown is more than just a group of friends playing together. It's an organized unit with:
- A unique identity (name, logo, tag)
- Clear roles (owner, manager, coach, players)
- Tournament history
- Rankings and points
- Social media presence
- Followers and fans

Teams exist **per game**. This means Mahir could be on a Valorant team and also on a PUBG Mobile team – they're completely separate. Each game's competitive scene is independent.

### How a Team is Created

Let's say Mahir decides to create his own Valorant team. Here's the journey:

**Step 1: The Basic Identity**

Mahir clicks "Create Team" and enters:

- **Team Name**: This is the official name. Mahir chooses "Dhaka Defenders". 
  - Rules: Must be unique across the entire platform
  - Must be between 3 to 50 characters
  - Can include spaces and special characters
  - Once chosen, it's permanent (can't be changed easily)

- **Team Tag**: A short abbreviation, like "DD" for Dhaka Defenders
  - Rules: Must be 2 to 10 characters
  - Must be UPPERCASE letters and numbers only
  - Must be unique globally
  - This appears in tournaments like "DD vs CW"

- **Team Description**: A paragraph explaining what the team is about. Mahir writes:
  *"Dhaka Defenders is a competitive Valorant team based in Bangladesh. We're looking for dedicated players who want to compete professionally in national and international tournaments. We practice daily from 8 PM to 11 PM and participate in weekend tournaments."*

- **Which Game**: Mahir selects "Valorant" from a dropdown. This locks the team to Valorant forever. The team will only appear in Valorant tournaments and rankings.

- **Region**: Mahir selects "Bangladesh". This helps with region-locked tournaments.

**Step 2: Visual Identity**

Every team needs a visual brand:

- **Team Logo**: Mahir designs or downloads a logo image. This should be square (like 512x512 pixels) and represent the team. Maybe it's a shield with "DD" letters, or a dragon graphic.

- **Banner Image**: A wide image (like 1920x400 pixels) that appears at the top of the team's profile page. Could be team colors, team name in stylish font, or action shots.

- **Roster Image**: Optional image showing all team members lined up (like team photos in traditional sports).

- **Team Colors**: Not a direct field, but teams often coordinate their profile aesthetics with specific colors.

**Step 3: The Tagline and Identity**

- **Tagline**: A short motto or slogan. Mahir writes: *"Defend the Legacy, Dominate the Game"*
  - Maximum 200 characters
  - Appears under the team name everywhere

**Step 4: Social Media Presence**

Teams are brands, and brands need social media. Mahir creates accounts for his team:

- **Twitter/X**: @DhakaDefenders - For announcements and updates
- **Instagram**: @dhaka.defenders - For photos and highlights  
- **Discord Server**: discord.gg/dhakadefenders - For community and recruitment
- **YouTube**: youtube.com/@dhakadefenders - For match VODs
- **Twitch**: twitch.tv/dhakadefenders - For live streaming
- **Facebook Page**: facebook.com/dhakadefenders - Very popular in Bangladesh
- **Linktree**: To link all socials in one place

The platform doesn't require these, but teams with social media presence look more professional and attract better players.

**Step 5: Team Settings and Privacy**

Mahir configures how his team operates:

**Visibility Settings:**
- **Is Team Public?**: YES - Anyone can view the team profile
- **Show Roster Publicly?**: YES - People can see who the players are
- **Show Statistics Publicly?**: YES - Tournament stats are visible
- **Show Tournaments Publicly?**: YES - Past competitions are visible
- **Show Achievements Publicly?**: YES - Trophies and badges displayed

Some professional teams keep rosters private until major tournaments to hide their strategies.

**Social Interaction:**
- **Allow Followers?**: YES - People can follow the team for updates
- **Allow Posts?**: YES - Team and members can post updates
- **Posts Require Approval?**: NO - Members can post freely (Mahir trusts his team)
- **Allow Join Requests?**: YES - Interested players can apply
- **Auto-Accept Join Requests?**: NO - Mahir wants to review applications manually

**Recruitment:**
- **Is Recruiting?**: YES - Shows a "We're Recruiting" badge on the profile
- **Minimum Rank Requirement?**: Mahir sets "Platinum or higher" to filter applicants
- **Require Application Message?**: YES - Applicants must explain why they want to join

**Member Permissions:**
- **Members Can Invite?**: NO - Only Mahir (as owner) can invite people
- **Members Can Post?**: YES - After joining, members can share on the team page
- **Require Post Approval?**: NO - Trust members to post responsibly

### Understanding Team Roster - The Members

This is the heart of any team: the people. In Valorant, a team needs at least 5 players to enter tournaments, but can have up to 8 roster members:
- 5 Starting Players (the main lineup)
- 2 Substitute Players (backups)
- 1 Coach (optional but recommended)
- 1 Analyst (optional)

But teams aren't just players. There are many roles:

**The Hierarchy - Organizational Roles:**

1. **Owner**: The person who created the team. This is Mahir. The owner has absolute control:
   - Can delete the entire team
   - Can kick anyone (except themselves)
   - Can promote/demote members to any role
   - Can change all team settings
   - Can register the team for tournaments
   - Can manage finances and prizes
   - There is EXACTLY ONE owner per team, always

2. **General Manager**: Like a CEO of the team. Handles business, sponsorships, tournament registrations
   - Can register for tournaments
   - Can manage finances
   - Can invite and remove members
   - Can edit team profile
   - Cannot remove the owner

3. **Team Manager**: Handles day-to-day operations
   - Can schedule practice sessions
   - Can manage the team calendar
   - Can invite players
   - Cannot manage finances
   - Cannot remove general manager or owner

4. **Head Coach**: The strategic leader
   - Designs team strategies and tactics
   - Reviews match replays
   - Conducts practice drills
   - Makes lineup decisions
   - Cannot manage team finances or profile

5. **Assistant Coach**: Helps the head coach
   - Focuses on specific aspects (aim training, map strategies)
   - Steps in when head coach is unavailable

6. **Performance Coach**: Optional role
   - Focuses on player wellness, mental health
   - Schedules and monitors practice routines

7. **Analyst**: The data person
   - Watches enemy teams' matches
   - Studies opponent strategies
   - Provides statistical insights
   - Creates reports and presentations

8. **Strategist**: Similar to analyst but focuses on tactics
   - Designs specific plays and strategies
   - Plans bans and picks (in games with drafting)

9. **Player**: The core competitors who actually play
   - Must have valid game ID (Riot ID for Valorant)
   - Must be active and available for matches
   - Primary responsibility: win games

10. **Substitute (Sub)**: Backup players
    - Can replace main players if someone is sick or unavailable
    - Must always be ready to step in
    - Often specialize in specific roles

11. **Content Creator**: Makes videos, streams, social media content
    - Not in competitive roster
    - Grows the team's brand
    - Attracts sponsors

12. **Social Media Manager**: Handles online presence
    - Posts updates on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook
    - Engages with fans
    - Manages team image

13. **Community Manager**: Interacts with fans
    - Responds to Discord messages
    - Organizes fan events
    - Moderates team channels

**The Roster - Tournament Positions:**

Separate from organizational roles, there are roster positions for actual tournaments:

1. **Starter**: One of the 5 main players who compete (for Valorant)
2. **Substitute**: Backup players who can swap in between maps
3. **Coach**: Sits behind players during LAN events, helps with strategy
4. **Analyst**: Provides data during matches

A person can have both an organizational role AND a roster position. For example:
- Mahir is the **Owner** (organizational) and also a **Starter** (roster position)
- Another member might be **Analyst** (organizational) and **Analyst** (roster) - same role
- Someone could be **Assistant Coach** (organizational) but not on the roster at all

**In-Game Roles - The Tactical Positions:**

Within the 5 starting players, each person has a specific role in Valorant:

1. **Duelist**: The aggressive entry fragger. Goes in first, takes aim duels, opens up sites. Characters like Jett, Raze, Reyna.

2. **Controller**: The smoke player. Controls map space with smokes, walls, slows. Characters like Omen, Brimstone, Astra.

3. **Sentinel**: The defensive anchor. Holds sites, watches flanks, plays post-plant. Characters like Sage, Cypher, Killjoy.

4. **Initiator**: Information gatherer. Uses utility to reveal enemies, flash for team. Characters like Sova, Breach, Skye.

5. **Flex**: Versatile player who can play multiple roles depending on team needs.

6. **IGL (In-Game Leader)**: The captain who makes strategic calls during matches. Can be any role, but often Controller or Sentinel.

**The Tournament Captain:**

One player must be designated as the team captain for official tournaments. This person:
- Represents the team in rule discussions
- Makes final decisions during technical pauses
- Submits match results
- Communicates with referees

Usually the IGL is also the captain, but not always. The owner (Mahir) might designate himself as captain even if another player calls strategies.

### Building the Roster - Inviting Members

Now Mahir needs to recruit players. He has several options:

**Option 1: Invite Specific Users**

If Mahir knows good players on the platform, he can directly invite them:
1. He finds their profile (search by username)
2. Clicks "Invite to Team"
3. Selects role: "Player"
4. Sets roster slot: "Starter"
5. Sets in-game role: "Duelist" (for example)
6. Adds a personal message: *"Hey! I saw you're a Duelist main with high rank. Want to join Dhaka Defenders? We practice 8-11 PM daily."*

The invited person receives a notification. They can:
- Accept: They immediately join with "Pending" status
- Decline: The invitation is rejected
- Ignore: Expires after 7 days

**Option 2: Public Recruitment**

Mahir sets the team to "Recruiting" status. Now when people browse teams, they see "Dhaka Defenders is recruiting!" Players can:
1. Click "Request to Join"
2. Fill out an application form:
   - Why do you want to join?
   - What role do you play?
   - What's your rank in Valorant?
   - When are you available?
3. Submit application

Mahir reviews applications in a queue. For each applicant, he can:
- **Approve**: They join with pending status
- **Reject**: They receive a polite rejection message
- **Request Interview**: Schedule a tryout match

**Option 2B: Smart Recruitment Posts (Modern Feature)**

But there's an even better way! Mahir can create a **Recruitment Post** that appears in the community feed. This is like posting a job advertisement that reaches thousands of players.

Here's how it works:

### Managing Team Members - Permissions and Trust

When someone joins the team, they have a status:

**Member Status:**
- **Pending**: Just joined, probation period. Can't register for tournaments yet
- **Active**: Full member, can participate in everything
- **Removed**: Kicked from the team, no longer a member

As owner, Mahir can grant specific permissions to each member. This is important for large teams where not everyone should have full control:

**Tournament Permissions:**
- **Can Register for Tournaments?**: Allow this person to sign up the team for competitions
- **Can Withdraw from Tournaments?**: Allow canceling registrations
- **Can Submit Match Results?**: Report scores after matches

**Roster Permissions:**
- **Can Invite Members?**: Allow recruiting new players
- **Can Remove Members?**: Allow kicking people (usually only managers)
- **Can Manage Roles?**: Change someone's role (Player → Sub, etc.)
- **Can Manage Permissions?**: Grant/revoke these permissions for others

**Team Profile Permissions:**
- **Can Edit Team Profile?**: Change description, banner, social links
- **Can Edit Team Settings?**: Modify privacy settings, recruitment status
- **Can Manage Social Links?**: Update Twitter, Discord, etc.

**Content Permissions:**
- **Can Create Posts?**: Write updates on team page
- **Can Manage Posts?**: Edit or delete any post (moderation)
- **Can Manage Announcements?**: Pin important messages

**Financial Permissions:**
- **Can Manage Finances?**: Handle prize money distribution
- **Can View Financial Reports?**: See team earnings/expenses

**Practice Permissions:**
- **Can Schedule Practice?**: Set practice times
- **Can Manage Schedule?**: Modify or cancel sessions

By default:
- **Owner**: ALL permissions automatically
- **General Manager**: Most permissions except deleting team
- **Team Manager**: Roster and schedule permissions
- **Coach**: Schedule permissions only
- **Player/Sub**: Can create posts only
- **Content Creator**: Can create posts and manage social links

Mahir carefully configures these. He gives:
- His best friend (general manager) → Full permissions except team deletion
- Head coach → Schedule management
- Players → Just posting rights
- Substitutes → Just posting rights

### Team Participation - Locks and Tournament Integrity

Here's something important: When a team registers for a tournament, the roster gets **locked**. This means:

- The 5 starting players, 2 subs, and coach are frozen
- No one can be removed or added
- Roles can't be changed
- This lasts until the tournament ends

Why? To prevent cheating. Imagine if teams could swap players mid-tournament, bringing in "ringers" (very skilled players borrowed from other teams). Tournament locks prevent this.

Each member has lock information:
- **Locked for Tournament**: Which tournament is the member locked for?
- **Locked At**: When did the lock happen?
- **Locked Until**: When does it expire?

If someone tries to leave a team while locked, the system prevents it. If the owner tries to kick a locked member, they get an error message.

### Team Rankings and Points

Every team has a point system that determines their rank:

**Total Points**: Automatically calculated based on:
- Tournament placements (1st place = 100 points, 2nd = 75, 3rd = 50, etc.)
- Match wins (each win = +5 points)
- Win streaks (3+ wins in a row = bonus)
- Special achievements (championship wins = big bonus)

**Adjustment Points**: Manual additions/subtractions by platform admins
- Penalty for rule violations (-50 points)
- Bonus for sportsmanship (+25 points)
- Correction for calculation errors

**Final Rank** = Total Points + Adjustment Points

Teams are ranked on leaderboards:
- Global Leaderboard (all teams, all games)
- Game-Specific Leaderboard (only Valorant teams, for example)
- Regional Leaderboard (only Bangladesh teams)
- Seasonal Leaderboard (resets every 3 months)

Mahir's goal: Get Dhaka Defenders into the Top 10 Bangladesh Valorant teams within 6 months.

### Team Communication - Staying Connected

A great team doesn't just play together - they talk, strategize, bond, and coordinate. DeltaCrown provides powerful communication tools built right into your team space.

#### Team Chat - Real-Time Messaging

Think of it like Discord, but integrated into your team profile.

**Basic Chat Features:**

Mahir opens the Dhaka Defenders team page. He sees a "Chat" tab. Inside:

```
[Today, 4:32 PM]
Mahir: Hey everyone! Tournament registration closes tonight. Are we ready?

[Today, 4:35 PM]
Rafi (Controller): Yeah! I confirmed my Riot ID yesterday.

[Today, 4:37 PM]
Tasnim (Coach): @Mahir did everyone check their game version? We need latest patch.

[Today, 4:40 PM]
Mahir: @everyone please verify you're on Episode 8 Act 2
```

Notice the **@mentions**? When Tasnim types @Mahir, Mahir gets a push notification even if he's not online. This ensures important messages aren't missed.

**Advanced Chat Features:**

**1. File Attachments:**

Rafi wants to share a strategy guide:
```
Rafi: Check this Haven defense setup
[Attachment: haven_defense_v2.png]
[Attachment: bind_setups.pdf]
```

Supported files:
- Images (PNG, JPG) - match screenshots, map strategies
- Videos (MP4) - gameplay highlights, VOD reviews
- Documents (PDF, DOCX) - tournament rules, player contracts
- Max size: 25MB per file

**2. Emoji Reactions:**

Instead of replying "ok" or "agreed" to every message, members can react:

```
Mahir: Practice tonight at 9 PM?
👍 (5)  ❤️ (3)  🔥 (2)
```

Quick way to show agreement without cluttering chat.

**3. Threaded Replies:**

When a long discussion happens, replies can get messy. Threads solve this:

```
Mahir: Who wants to IGL for tomorrow's match?
  └─ Thread (8 replies)
      Rafi: I can do it if needed
      Tasnim: Rafi has good calls, let him try
      Mahir: Agreed! Rafi you're IGL tomorrow
```

Main chat stays clean, detailed discussions happen in threads.

**4. Pinned Messages:**

Important info that everyone needs to see:

```
📌 PINNED MESSAGE:

🏆 Tournament Schedule:
- Check-in: Dec 21, 1:00-1:45 PM
- First Match: Dec 21, 2:15 PM
- Discord Server: discord.gg/gamerhub-valorant

📌 PINNED MESSAGE:

Team Rules:
1. Mandatory practice: Mon/Wed/Fri 9-11 PM
2. No toxic behavior (instant removal)
3. Notify 24hrs before missing practice
```

Pinned messages appear at top of chat. Perfect for:
- Tournament schedules
- Team rules
- Practice timings
- Discord/voice chat links

**5. Markdown Support:**

Coach Tasnim shares detailed strategy:

```
Tasnim: **Bind Defense Plan**

*A Site Setup:*
- Rafi (Brim): Smoke entrance + molly default
- Mahir (Jett): Hold shower with OP
- Karim (KJ): Turret truck, alarm bot cubby

*B Site Setup:*
- Rahim (Omen): Paranoia long, smoke elbow
- Anik (Sage): Wall entrance, slow orb garden

If they go **A heavy**, Omen TPs from B to help.
```

Supports:
- **Bold**, *Italic*, `Code`, ~~Strikethrough~~
- Bullet lists, numbered lists  
- Links: [Our VODs](youtube.com/dhaka-defenders)

**6. Read Receipts:**

Mahir sends: "Everyone read tournament rules by tonight."

He can see:
- ✅ Rafi - Read 5:23 PM
- ✅ Rahim - Read 5:45 PM
- ✅ Karim - Read 6:10 PM
- ⚠️ Anik - Not read yet

This helps ensure critical messages don't get missed.

#### Discussion Board - Organized Conversations

Chat is great for quick messages. But for deeper topics, there's the **Discussion Board** - a forum inside your team.

**How It Works:**

Instead of everything in one chat stream, discussions are organized into **threads** (topics).

Mahir clicks "Discussions" tab. He sees:

```
📢 ANNOUNCEMENTS (3 threads)
  📌 [IMPORTANT] Tournament Registration Open - Dec 15
  📌 Team Rules Updated - Dec 10
  Practice Schedule Change - Dec 8

5. **Feedback** (💡): Members suggest improvements
6. **Events** (🎉): LAN meetups, watch parties, team hangouts
7. **General** (💬): Casual discussions, off-topic, team bonding

## Part 3: The Tournament Ecosystem

### What is a Tournament?

A tournament is a competitive event where players or teams compete to be the best. Think of it like a football World Cup, but for video games.

In DeltaCrown, tournaments can be:
- **Huge**: 128 teams competing over a month
- **Medium**: 16 teams in a weekend
- **Small**: 8 teams in a single day
- **Massive**: 256 solo players in a battle royale

Anyone can organize a tournament on DeltaCrown. You could be:
- **A professional esports organization** hosting a national championship
- **A gaming cafe** hosting a local event for their customers
- **DeltaCrown itself** running official platform tournaments
- **A community organizer** bringing together regional players
- **A content creator** organizing an event for their fans

### Types of Tournaments - Understanding Game Formats

**Team-Only Games (Must register as team):**

1. **Valorant (5v5)**:

**Squad/Solo Games (Both formats possible):**

6. **PUBG Mobile**:
   - **Squad Tournaments**: 4-player teams compete
     * 16-20 squads in a match
     * Placement + kill points
     * Multiple rounds (usually 6 matches)
     * Example: "PUBG Mobile Bangladesh Championship"
   - **Solo Tournaments**: Individual players compete
     * 100 players in one match (battle royale)
     * Last person standing wins
     * Example: "Solo Survivor Series"

7. **Free Fire**:
   - **Squad Tournaments**: 4-player teams (most common)
     * 12 squads per match
     * Fast-paced, 10-minute matches
     * Placement + kill scoring

     * 50 players per match
     * Pure battle royale format

**1v1 Games (Solo tournaments only):**

8. **eFootball**:
   - Solo tournaments ONLY (1v1 matches)
   - Players compete head-to-head
   - Example: "eFootball Bangladesh Cup" - 32 players, single elimination

   - Can be BO1, BO3, or BO5 series

9. **FC Mobile (EA Sports FC Mobile)**:
   - Solo tournaments ONLY (1v1)

10. **FIFA / EA Sports FC (Console/PC)**:
   - Solo tournaments (1v1) - most common
   - Example: "FIFA Bangladesh Championship" - 64 players, Swiss system
   - **Optional**: 2v2 Pro Clubs (team format, rarely used)

**Hybrid Formats (Special cases):**

11. **Call of Duty Mobile (Alternative)**:
   - While primarily 5v5 teams, CODM also supports:
   - **Gunfight Mode**: 2v2 tournaments
   - **1v1 Duel Mode**: Quick duels (not common for serious tournaments)

**Tournament Type Selection Rules:**

When creating a tournament, organizers must respect game format:

✅ **Allowed:**
- Valorant → Team tournament (5v5)
- PUBG Mobile → Squad (4v4) OR Solo (1v1 BR)
- eFootball → Solo tournament (1v1)

❌ **NOT Allowed:**
- Valorant → Solo tournament (game doesn't support 1v1 competitive)
- Mobile Legends → Solo tournament (5v5 only)
- CS2 → Solo tournament (5v5 only)

**Registration Differences:**

**Team Tournaments:**
- Team captain registers on behalf of entire team
- All 5+ members must have valid game IDs
- All members check in together
- One prize pool shared among team
- Example registration: "Dhaka Defenders (5 players) registers for Valorant tournament"

**Solo Tournaments:**
- Each individual registers separately
- No team needed
- Individual check-in
- Individual prizes
- Example registration: "MahirGG registers for eFootball tournament"

**Battle Royale (Special case):**
- For PUBG/Free Fire squad tournaments:
  * Captain registers team (4 players)
  * Multiple squads in same match (16-20 squads)
  * Scoring based on placement + kills
  * Multiple rounds, cumulative points
- For solo BR tournaments:
  * Individual registration
  * 50-100 players per match
  * Survival-based scoring

### The Tournament Creation Journey

Let's say a gaming organization called "GamerHub" wants to organize a Valorant tournament. Here's how they do it on DeltaCrown:

**Step 1: Basic Information**

The organizer fills in:

**Tournament Name**: The full title. GamerHub chooses: *"GamerHub Valorant Championship December 2025"*
- Should be descriptive and unique
- Include game name, organizer, time period
- Maximum 200 characters

**Description**: A detailed explanation. GamerHub writes:
*"Join us for the biggest Valorant tournament in Dhaka this December! 16 teams will battle in a single-elimination bracket for a 50,000 BDT prize pool. All matches will be played online and streamed live on YouTube. The top 3 teams will receive trophies and certificates. Registration is open until December 20th."*

This description appears on the tournament page and tells potential participants everything important.

**Which Game?**: GamerHub selects "Valorant" from the dropdown. This determines:
- Which teams can register (only Valorant teams)
- What game-specific rules apply
- Which player IDs are required (Riot ID)
- Tournament format options

**Tournament Format**: This is crucial - it determines how matches are played.

Available formats:

1. **Single Elimination**: 
   - Lose once, you're out
   - Fast tournament (16 teams = 4 rounds)
   - Most intense pressure
   - Example: 16 teams → 8 → 4 → 2 → Winner

2. **Double Elimination**:
   - Lose once, drop to loser's bracket
   - Lose twice, you're eliminated
   - Longer tournament but more fair
   - Example: Winner's bracket + Loser's bracket → Grand Finals

3. **Round Robin**:
   - Everyone plays everyone
   - Most matches, takes longest time
   - Most fair (no lucky brackets)
   - Example: 8 teams, each plays 7 matches

4. **Swiss System**:
   - Multiple rounds, matched by record
   - Winners play winners, losers play losers
   - Used in large tournaments (64+ teams)
   - Example: 6 rounds, best record wins

5. **Group Stage → Playoffs**:
   - First phase: Groups (round robin)
   - Second phase: Bracket (single/double elimination)
   - Most professional tournaments use this
   - Example: 16 teams → 4 groups of 4 → Top 8 → Playoffs

GamerHub chooses: **Single Elimination** (fast, exciting, fits in one weekend)

**Step 2: Tournament Logistics**

**Platform**: Where the tournament happens
- **PC**: For Valorant, CS2, Dota 2
- **Mobile**: For PUBG Mobile, Free Fire, Mobile Legends
- **Console**: PS5, Xbox, Switch
- **Cross-platform**: Multiple platforms allowed

GamerHub chooses: **PC** (Valorant is PC-only)

**Mode**: How participants compete
- **Online**: Everyone plays from home (internet-based)
- **LAN**: Everyone gathers in one physical location
- **Hybrid**: Some online, some LAN (like online qualifiers → LAN finals)

GamerHub chooses: **Online** (easier for participants, no venue needed)

If they chose LAN or Hybrid, they'd need to provide:
- **Venue Name**: "TechHub Convention Center"
- **Venue Address**: "123 Gulshan Avenue, Dhaka 1212"
- **Venue City**: "Dhaka"
- **Map Link**: Google Maps URL for navigation

**Capacity**: How many participants?
- **Minimum Participants**: The tournament needs at least this many to happen (GamerHub sets: 8 teams)
- **Maximum Participants**: The cap (GamerHub sets: 16 teams)

Why minimum? If only 3 teams register, it's not worth running the tournament. If minimum isn't met by registration deadline, the tournament is cancelled and entry fees refunded.

Why maximum? Logistics. Can't run a 1000-team tournament in one weekend.

**Step 3: Important Dates and Timeline**

**Registration Period:**
- **Registration Opens**: When can people start signing up? (December 5, 2025 at 12:00 AM)
- **Registration Closes**: Deadline for sign-ups (December 20, 2025 at 11:59 PM)

This gives participants 15 days to register.

**Tournament Period:**
- **Tournament Starts**: First match begins (December 21, 2025 at 2:00 PM)
- **Tournament Ends**: Expected completion (December 22, 2025 at 8:00 PM)

This is a weekend tournament - runs Saturday and Sunday.

**Why the gap between registration close and tournament start?**
- Organizers need time to verify participants
- Create brackets
- Handle any last-minute issues
- Give participants time to prepare

**Step 4: Prizes - The Incentive**

This is what everyone plays for!

**Prize Pool Amount**: Total money/value available (50,000 Taka)

**Prize Currency**: What type? (BDT - Bangladeshi Taka)

**Prize in DeltaCoin**: Some tournaments offer virtual currency instead or in addition (0 DeltaCoin in this case)

**Prize Distribution**: How is it split among winners?

GamerHub decides:
- **1st Place**: 50% (25,000 Taka)
- **2nd Place**: 30% (15,000 Taka)
- **3rd Place**: 15% (7,500 Taka)
- **4th Place**: 5% (2,500 Taka)

The platform stores this as: 
- Position 1: 50%
- Position 2: 30%
- Position 3: 15%
- Position 4: 5%

When the tournament ends and places are determined, the system automatically calculates:
- Winner gets 50% of 50,000 = 25,000 Taka
- Runner-up gets 30% of 50,000 = 15,000 Taka
- And so on...

**Non-Monetary Prizes**: Sometimes tournaments offer:
- Physical trophies
- Medals/certificates
- Gaming gear (keyboards, mice, headsets)
- Sponsorship opportunities

GamerHub adds in description: *"Winners receive champion trophies and individual certificates for all members."*

**Step 5: Entry Fees and Payments**

Should participants pay to enter? GamerHub decides: **Yes**

**Has Entry Fee?**: Enabled

**Entry Fee Amount**: 1,000 Taka per team

**Entry Fee Currency**: BDT

**Entry Fee in DeltaCoin**: Could also accept 100 DeltaCoin as alternative (0 in this case)

**Why charge entry fees?**
- Funds the prize pool (16 teams × 1,000 = 16,000 Taka collected)
- Ensures serious participants (free tournaments get many no-shows)
- Covers operational costs (streaming, admins, platform fees)
- Increases prize pool beyond sponsor contributions

**Payment Methods Accepted**: GamerHub enables:
- ☑ bKash (most popular mobile payment in Bangladesh)
- ☑ Nagad (government mobile payment)
- ☑ Rocket (Dutch-Bangla Bank mobile payment)
- ☑ Bank Transfer (traditional banking)
- ☐ DeltaCoin (not accepted for this tournament)

When teams register, they select a payment method, pay the amount, and upload proof (screenshot of transaction).

**Fee Waiver System**: To encourage top teams, GamerHub enables:
- **Enable Fee Waiver**: Yes
- **Waive Fee for Top N Teams**: 4

This means the top 4 highest-ranked teams on the platform get to play for FREE. Why?
- Attracts pro teams
- Increases tournament prestige
- Rewards platform loyalty
- Creates competitive brackets

**Step 6: Tournament Media and Branding**

**Banner Image**: A large promotional image (1920x600 pixels). Shows:
- Tournament name
- Date
- Prize pool
- Game logo
- Sponsor logos

**Thumbnail Image**: Smaller square image (600x600) for listing pages

**Promo Video**: YouTube/Vimeo link to hype video:
- Tournament announcement
- Past event highlights
- Prize reveals
- Sponsor messages

**Rules Document (PDF)**: Detailed rulebook uploaded as PDF. Contains:
- Match format (BO3 semi-finals, BO5 finals)
- Map selection process
- Side selection rules
- Technical pause rules (2 per team, 90 seconds each)
- Disconnection protocols (10 minutes to rejoin)
- Substitution rules (only between maps)
- Anti-cheat requirements
- Sportsmanship guidelines
- Disqualification criteria
- Dispute resolution process

GamerHub uploads a 15-page rulebook.

**Step 7: Live Streaming**

Modern tournaments are spectator events!

**YouTube Stream URL**: https://youtube.com/live/gamerhub-val-championship
**Twitch Stream URL**: https://twitch.tv/gamerhub_esports

Matches are broadcast live with:
- Professional casters/commentators
- Match analysis
- Player interviews
- Sponsor segments

Some tournaments are private (not streamed) if participants want privacy.

**Step 8: Rules and Terms**

**Rules Text**: Written explanation of how the tournament works. Includes:
- Match schedule
- Check-in procedure
- Communication channels (Discord server)
- Protest/dispute process
- Prize claim process

**Terms and Conditions**: Legal agreement. Participants agree to:
- Follow all rules
- Behave respectfully
- Not use cheats or exploits
- Accept organizer decisions
- Provide real information for prizes
- Allow their gameplay to be streamed
- Platform's liability limitations

**Require Terms Acceptance?**: YES - participants must check a box agreeing to terms before registering

**Step 9: Tournament Features - Advanced Options**

**Check-In System**: Ensures teams actually show up

- **Enable Check-In?**: YES
- **Check-In Opens**: 30 minutes before tournament start
- **Check-In Closes**: 15 minutes before tournament start

How it works:
1. December 21 at 1:30 PM, check-in opens
2. Team captains must click "Check In" button
3. Confirms team is ready and online
4. Check-in closes at 1:45 PM
5. Any team that didn't check in gets marked "No-Show"
6. No-show teams are disqualified
7. Bracket adjusted for actual attendees

Why? Prevents delays from absent teams.

**Dynamic Seeding**: How to order teams in bracket?

- **Disable**: Random placement
- **Enable**: Seed by team ranking (highest ranked team vs lowest ranked team)

GamerHub enables it. Result:
- Seed 1 (best team) plays Seed 16 (weakest team) in round 1
- Seed 2 plays Seed 15
- Ensures best teams don't meet until finals

**Live Updates**:
- **Enable**: Match results posted in real-time to tournament page
- **Disable**: Results only shown after tournament ends

**Certificates**:
- **Enable**: Winners receive digital certificates (PDF) with their names
- Great for portfolios and resumes

**Challenges**:
- **Enable**: Participants can challenge referee decisions (appeal system)
- **Disable**: All decisions are final

**Fan Voting**:
- **Enable**: Spectators can vote for MVP, best play, etc.
- Adds community engagement

**Step 10: Tournament Status - The Lifecycle**

Tournaments go through stages:

1. **Draft**: Organizer is still setting it up (not visible to public)

2. **Pending Approval**: Submitted to DeltaCrown admins for review
   - Admins check: Is prize pool realistic? Are rules fair? Is organizer trustworthy?
   - Can be rejected if suspicious

3. **Published**: Approved and visible on platform, but registration not open yet

4. **Registration Open**: Participants can now sign up!
   - Tournament appears in "Open for Registration" listing

### Tournament Registration - The Participant Perspective

Let's say Mahir's team "Dhaka Defenders" wants to join GamerHub's tournament. Here's what happens:

**Step 1: Discovery**

Mahir browses DeltaCrown's tournament page. He sees:
- Filters: Game (Valorant), Region (Bangladesh), Status (Registration Open)
- GamerHub's tournament appears in the list
- Shows: Name, Date, Prize Pool, Entry Fee, Teams Registered (7/16)

Mahir clicks on it to see details.

**Step 2: Reviewing Requirements**

Tournament detail page shows:
- Full description
- Rules PDF (Mahir downloads and reads)
- Prize distribution
- Entry fee: 1,000 Taka
- Dates and schedule
- Current registrations (7 teams already signed up)

Mahir checks if his team qualifies:
- ✓ Team has 5 active Valorant players
- ✓ All members have verified emails
- ✓ All members have Riot IDs filled in
- ✓ Team has won 2 tournaments (ranked #12 in BD, so no fee waiver)
- ✓ No roster members are locked in another tournament

Everything checks out!

**Step 3: Starting Registration**

Mahir clicks "Register Team". The platform asks:
- **Which team?**: Dhaka Defenders (pre-filled since he's owner)
- **Your role**: Team Captain/Manager
- **Contact Discord**: For tournament communication

**Step 4: Roster Submission**

System auto-detects Dhaka Defenders' roster:
- 5 Starting players (all with STARTER roster slot)
- 2 Substitutes
- 1 Coach

Mahir reviews the roster:

| Name | Roster Slot | In-Game Role | Riot ID | Discord |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| MahirGG | Starter | Duelist | MahirGG#BD01 | mahir#7890 |
| RahimVAL | Starter | Controller | RahimV#9999 | rahim_val#4321 |
| SentinelBoss | Starter | Sentinel | Sentinel#BD88 | sboss#1111 |
| InitFury | Starter | Initiator | Fury#SEA1 | fury_init#2233 |
| FlexPro | Starter | Flex | FlexGod#0001 | flexpro#5544 |
| SubDuelist | Substitute | Duelist | SubD#BD02 | subd#6677 |
| SubControl | Substitute | Controller | SubC#BD03 | subc#8899 |
| CoachAli | Coach | N/A | CoachAli#9000 | coach_ali#0011 |

Everything looks good. All Riot IDs are valid.

**Smart Registration Magic - What Just Happened?**

Notice how EASY that was? Mahir didn't manually type all 8 members' Riot IDs, Discord names, and roles. The platform did it automatically. This is **smart registration** in action.

**How Smart Registration Works:**

**1. Auto-Fill from Team Profile:**
When Mahir clicked "Register Team", the system:
- Pulled the full team roster from Dhaka Defenders' profile
- Pre-filled all player names, Riot IDs, Discord IDs
- Assigned roles based on team settings (Duelist, Controller, etc.)
- Pre-populated contact information

Manual entry would take 15-20 minutes. Smart auto-fill? Done in 10 seconds.

**2. Draft System (Auto-Save Every 30 Seconds):**

Tournament registration can be complex. Maybe Mahir needs to:
- Confirm availability with each player (takes time)
- Check everyone's Riot IDs are correct
- Verify Discord usernames
- Discuss preferred match times with coach

What if his internet disconnects? What if he needs to step away for dinner?

No problem! The platform auto-saves progress every 30 seconds:

```
💾 Auto-saved registration draft
Last saved: 30 seconds ago
```

**3. Cross-Device Resume:**

Mahir starts registration on his phone at 2 PM. Then:
- He goes to class (3 PM)
- Opens laptop at home (6 PM)
- Logs into DeltaCrown
- Clicks "Resume Registration"
- All his previous entries are there!

How? Each registration gets a unique identifier (UUID). When Mahir logs in on any device, the system retrieves his draft.

Draft persistence: 7 days (after that, expired and cleared).

**4. Validation in Real-Time:**

As Mahir fills the form, the system validates instantly:

```
❌ Riot ID: "MahirGG" → ERROR: Missing tag (Format: Name#TAG)
✅ Riot ID: "MahirGG#BD01" → VALID ✅

❌ Discord: "mahir" → WARNING: Missing discriminator
✅ Discord: "mahir#7890" → VALID ✅

⚠️ Player "RahimVAL" → Not verified yet (warning shown)
```

This prevents errors BEFORE submission (instead of rejection later).

**5. Dynamic Questions Based on Game:**

GamerHub's tournament is for Valorant, so the platform asks:
- "Team's average rank?" → Dropdown shows Valorant ranks (Iron to Radiant)
- "Preferred map bans?" → Shows Valorant maps (Haven, Bind, etc.)

If it were PUBG Mobile:
- "Squad's average tier?" → Bronze to Conqueror
- "Preferred drop location?" → Erangel zones

The system knows which game the tournament is for and adjusts questions automatically.

**6. Conditional Logic:**

Tournament organizer set this rule:
"If team rank is below Platinum, ask: Why should we accept your team?"

Mahir's team average is Platinum 2 (above threshold), so this question doesn't appear.

But if another team with Gold average registers, they see:
```
⚠️ Your team's average rank (Gold 3) is below the recommended level (Platinum).

Optional: Explain why you believe your team is ready for this tournament.
[Text field - 500 characters max]
```

**7. Conflict Detection:**

System checks for scheduling conflicts:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Your team is registered for another tournament on Dec 21.

Existing Registration:
  Tournament: "Dhaka Local Cup"
  Date: December 21, 2025
  Match Time: 4:00 PM

This Tournament:
  Date: December 21, 2025
  Match Time: 2:15 PM

These may overlap. Do you want to continue?
[Yes, Continue] [Cancel Registration]
```

This prevents teams from double-booking.

**8. Auto-Approval (If Eligible):**

Some tournaments have "auto-approval" rules:

```
Auto-Approval Criteria (set by organizer):
- All players have verified accounts ✅
- Team has participated in 3+ tournaments ✅
- No payment disputes in last 6 months ✅
- All roster slots filled correctly ✅
```

If Mahir's team meets ALL criteria, registration status instantly becomes:
**Status: Auto-Approved ✅** (no manual review needed)

If ANY criteria fails:
**Status: Pending Review** (organizer will manually check)

**What Mahir Experiences:**

Old System (Manual Entry - Estimated 20 minutes):
```
1. Type team name manually
2. Add Player 1: Name, Riot ID, Discord, Role
3. Add Player 2: Name, Riot ID, Discord, Role
4. Add Player 3: ... (repeat 8 times!)
5. Double-check all IDs (typos common)
6. Fill tournament questions
7. Submit (hope no errors!)
8. Get rejection: "Player 3 Riot ID invalid"
9. Start over, fix, resubmit
```

Smart System (Auto-Fill - Estimated 3 minutes):
```
1. Click "Register Team" → Auto-filled!
2. Review roster (all correct? Yes!)
3. Select captain (MahirGG)
4. Answer 3 custom questions (pre-filled suggestions)
5. Accept terms
6. Pay entry fee
7. Done! ✅
8. Real-time validation caught any errors BEFORE submission
```

**Saved time: 17 minutes. Reduced errors: 90%.**

This is the power of smart registration!

**Step 5: Captain Designation**

System asks: "Who is the tournament captain?" (the person representing the team)

Mahir selects himself (MahirGG). The captain will:
- Check in the team on tournament day
- Communicate with referees
- Report match results
- Make decisions during technical issues

**Step 6: Custom Questions** (if organizer added any)

GamerHub added these questions:
- "What is your team's average Valorant rank?" → Mahir answers: "Platinum 2"
- "Preferred match time slot?" → Mahir selects: "Afternoon (2-6 PM)"
- "Any special accommodations needed?" → Mahir writes: "None"

**Step 7: Terms Acceptance**

Mahir must check boxes:
- ☑ I have read and accept the tournament rules
- ☑ All team members are available on tournament dates
- ☑ All information provided is accurate
- ☑ I agree to DeltaCrown's terms and conditions

**Step 8: Payment**

Since there's a 1,000 Taka entry fee:

- Mahir selects payment method: **bKash**
- System shows payment instructions:
  - Send 1,000 BDT to bKash number: 01712345678
  - Reference: "TOURNAMENT-123-DD"
  - Take a screenshot of successful transaction
- Mahir opens his bKash app
- Sends 1,000 Taka
- Takes screenshot
- Uploads screenshot to DeltaCrown

**Step 9: Registration Status**

After submission, registration status is: **Payment Submitted**

What happens now:
- GamerHub admins review the payment screenshot
- Verify the amount and transaction ID
- If valid: Status → **Confirmed**
- If invalid: Status → **Rejected** (with explanation)

Usually takes 24 hours to verify.

**Step 10: Confirmation**

Next day, status changes to **Confirmed**!

Mahir receives:
- Email confirmation
- Discord invite to tournament server
- Match schedule (once bracket is published)
- Check-in instructions

Dhaka Defenders is officially registered! Now they wait for tournament day.

### Behind the Scenes - The Organizer's Tournament Journey

We've seen the tournament from Mahir's perspective as a player. But what about the people running it?

**December 1-15 - Registrations Roll In**

Rahim watches dashboard:
- Day 1: 3 teams registered
- Day 5: 8 teams registered
- Day 10: 12 teams registered
- Day 15: 14 teams registered

He reviews each registration:
- **Dhaka Defenders**: 5 players + 2 subs + 1 coach ✅ All valid Riot IDs ✅
- **Chittagong Warriors**: 5 players + 1 sub + 1 coach ✅
- **Rajshahi Eagles**: 5 players only ⚠️ (No subs, but allowed)

All look good!

**December 18 - A Problem Registration**

Team "BD Esports" registers, but:
- Player "AliGG" has invalid Riot ID: "Ali123" (should be Ali#TAG format)
- Player "Kamal" hasn't verified email

Rahim clicks **"Request Correction"**. System sends automated message to team captain:

```
⚠️ Registration Issue Detected

Your team registration for "Bangladesh Valorant Winter Championship" 
has issues that must be fixed before December 20:

1. Player "AliGG" - Invalid Riot ID format
   Current: Ali123
   Required format: Name#TAG (example: SomBra#0001)

2. Player "Kamal" - Email not verified
   Action: Check inbox for verification link

Please fix these within 48 hours, or your registration will be rejected.

[Fix Issues]
```

BD Esports fixes issues the next day. Rahim approves.

**December 20, 8:00 PM - Registration Closes**

Final count: **14 teams registered** (not 16 - 2 slots went unfilled).

Now comes the crucial part: **Bracket Generation**.

#### Bracket Generation (December 20, 8:15 PM)

Rahim opens **Tournament Control Panel**. Big button: **"Generate Bracket"**.

He clicks it. System shows options:

**Bracket Format:** Single Elimination (already chosen)

**Seeding Method - Choose One:**

1. **Slot Order** (First-Come-First-Served):
   - Team that registered first gets Seed #1
   - Fair for community tournaments
   - No favoritism

2. **Random**:
   - Pure lottery
   - Shuffle all teams randomly
   - Exciting but unpredictable

3. **Ranked**:
   - Based on team platform rankings
   - Highest-ranked team gets Seed #1
   - Most competitive format
   - Top teams face lower teams first

4. **Manual**:
   - Rahim assigns seeds himself
   - Full control
   - Useful for invited tournaments

Rahim chooses **Slot Order** because it's fair for an open community tournament.

**System Generates Bracket:**

```

Result status: ✅ CONFIRMED

Match continues to Map 2.

#### Dispute Management (December 21, 3:50 PM - Match 4 Disputed)

**Alert Notification:**

```
🚨 DISPUTE FILED
Priority: HIGH
Match: Match 4 (Barisal Blazers vs Mymensingh Mavericks)
Reason: Score Mismatch
```

Rahim opens **Dispute Review Panel**.

**Dispute Details:**

```
Dispute #001
Filed by: Mymensingh Mavericks (losing team)
Against: Barisal Blazers

Referee Submitted:
  Winner: Barisal Blazers
  Map 2 (Bind) Score: 13-10
  Evidence: [Screenshot: ref_scoreboard.png]

Dispute Claim:
  "The actual score was 13-12, not 13-10. Here's proof:"
  Evidence: [Screenshot: team_scoreboard.png]
  
Timestamp Analysis:
  Referee screenshot: 3:42 PM
  Team screenshot: 3:48 PM (6 minutes LATER - suspicious!)
```

**Rahim's Investigation:**

He opens both screenshots:

1. **Referee's screenshot** (taken live during match):
   - Timestamp: 3:42:15 PM
   - Shows final scoreboard immediately after match
   - Score: 13-10
   - Match ID: #VAL-BD-WC-2025-M4-Map2

2. **Team's screenshot** (disputing team):
   - Timestamp: 3:48:22 PM (6 minutes later!)
   - Shows a scoreboard with 13-12
   - Match ID: #VAL-BD-WC-2025-M4-Map2 (same match)

Wait, same match ID but different score? How?

**Rahim checks referee notes:**

```
@RahmanRef notes:
"Match ended 13-10. I spectated live. Mymensingh requested replay 
to review a round, I allowed it for their learning. They replayed 
one round in custom match to understand their mistake. That's why 
their screenshot shows different time + slightly different score. 
The OFFICIAL match ended 13-10."
```

**Rahim's Decision:**

```
DISPUTE RESOLUTION:

Resolved For: Barisal Blazers (submitter)
Resolution: Opponent's screenshot is from practice replay, not official match

Explanation:
"Referee spectated the match live and confirmed 13-10 score. The 
disputed screenshot was taken 6 minutes AFTER the match ended, during 
a practice replay that the losing team requested. The official match 
result stands: Barisal Blazers won 13-10.

Evidence:
1. Referee's screenshot taken at match end (3:42 PM)
2. Team's screenshot taken 6 min later (3:48 PM)  
3. Referee's live spectator testimony (authoritative)

Original result confirmed."
```

Rahim clicks **"Resolve Dispute"**.

Both teams notified. Match result finalized: **Barisal Blazers wins 2-0**.

Barisal advances to Quarterfinals.

### The Platform Economy

**Money Flow:**

**Entry Fees** → Platform (30% fee) + Prize Pool (70%)

Example:

- Platform fee: 4,800 Taka (covers payment processing, hosting, staff)
- Prize pool: 11,200 Taka (plus sponsor contributions)

**DeltaCoin System:**

Users earn DeltaCoin through:
- Tournament prizes (10% of cash prize in DeltaCoin)
- Daily login (5 DC per day)
- Achievements (varies)
- Referrals (50 DC per friend who joins)
- Purchases (can buy DC with real money)

Users spend DeltaCoin on:
- Tournament entry fees (alternative to cash)
- Profile customization (animated avatars, themes)
- Boosting posts (increased visibility)
- Premium features (detailed statistics)

DeltaCoin is NOT convertible to real money (to comply with regulations).

### Platform Moderation

To keep tournaments fair:

**Anti-Cheat:**
- Tournaments can require specific anti-cheat software
- Players must record POV (point of view) during matches
- Suspicions can be reported
- Staff review footage

**Fair Play:**
- Reputation scores track behavior
- Repeated reports lower reputation
- Low reputation prevents tournament participation
- Toxicity results in platform bans

**Dispute Resolution:**
- Match disputes handled by referees
- Appeals reviewed by senior staff
- Evidence required (screenshots, videos)
- Final decisions within 48 hours

**Identity Verification:**
- Email required for all accounts
- Phone verification for tournaments with prizes > 5,000 Taka
