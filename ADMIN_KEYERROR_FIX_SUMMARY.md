# ‚úÖ Admin KeyError Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Statement

**Error encountered:**
```
KeyError at /admin/tournaments/tournament/1/change/
"Key 'slug' not found in 'TournamentForm'. Choices are: ."
```

**When:** Opening any COMPLETED (archived) tournament in Django admin  
**Why:** Conflict between readonly fields and fieldsets configuration  
**Impact:** Could not view or manage archived tournaments  

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Archive System (Phase 7)

In Phase 7, we implemented an archive system where COMPLETED tournaments become read-only by making all fields readonly.

### The Problem

**Django's prepopulated fields feature was the culprit!**

When you define `get_prepopulated_fields()` like this:
```python
def get_prepopulated_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    return {"slug": ("name",)}  # Auto-fill slug from name
```

Django tries to access `form['slug']` to attach JavaScript for auto-filling. But for COMPLETED tournaments:
- All fields are marked readonly
- Readonly fields are NOT in the form object
- `form['slug']` doesn't exist
- Result: **`KeyError: "Key 'slug' not found in 'TournamentForm'"`**

### The Conflict

```python
# Admin configuration
get_prepopulated_fields() ‚Üí {"slug": ("name",)}  # Expects form['slug']
get_readonly_fields() ‚Üí ["name", "slug", ...]     # Removes from form

# Django tries: form['slug'].widget.attrs.update(...)
# Result: KeyError! ‚ùå
```

## Solution Implemented

### Four-Part Fix

#### 1. Enhanced `get_readonly_fields()`
Marks all model fields as readonly for archived tournaments

#### 2. NEW: `get_fields()` Method
Explicitly lists all fields to display for archived tournaments - takes precedence over fieldsets

#### 3. Updated `get_fieldsets()`
Provides clean single-section layout for archived, organized multi-section for editable

#### 4. **CRITICAL: Fixed `get_prepopulated_fields()`** ‚ö°
```python
def get_prepopulated_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    # No prepopulated fields for archived tournaments!
    if obj and obj.status == 'COMPLETED':
        return {}  # Empty - prevents KeyError
    return {"slug": ("name",)}
```

**This was the missing piece!** By returning an empty dict for archived tournaments, Django doesn't try to set up prepopulation for fields that don't exist in the form.

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests ‚úÖ

**Script 1:** `scripts/test_archived_admin_fix.py`
**Script 2:** `scripts/test_tournament_1_fix.py` (Specific test for ID 1)

```bash
‚úÖ All tests passed! Admin configuration is correct.
‚úÖ Prepopulated fields: {} (empty for archived)
‚úÖ Form generation: No KeyError
‚úÖ All 6 admin methods work correctly
```

### Manual Testing ‚úÖ

**URL:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/tournaments/tournament/1/change/`

**Before fix:**
```
‚ùå KeyError: "Key 'slug' not found in 'TournamentForm'"
‚ùå Page crashed at form generation
‚ùå Could not access archived tournaments
```

**After fix:**
```
‚úÖ Page loads successfully
‚úÖ Yellow "ARCHIVED TOURNAMENT" banner displays
‚úÖ All fields visible and readonly
‚úÖ No errors in console
```

### System Check ‚úÖ

```bash
$ python manage.py check
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
