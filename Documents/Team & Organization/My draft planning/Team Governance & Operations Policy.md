 **📜 DeltaCrown Team Governance & Operations Policy**  
**Version:** 2.0 (Effective 2026\)

**Scope:** Applies to all Independent Teams, Organizations, Players, and Managers.

---

## **1\. Definitions & Ecosystem Structure**

DeltaCrown recognizes two distinct entities within its competitive ecosystem:

1. **Independent Team:** A standalone squad owned by a single user (Captain/Owner). Designed for casual play or grassroots competition.  
2. **Organization (Org):** A verified business entity that owns multiple teams (Departments) across different games.  
3. **The "Slot":** The competitive license to play. In Independent teams, the User owns the slot. In Organizations, the Organization owns the slot.

---

## **2\. Eligibility & Account Creation**

### **2.1. Team Creation (The "Open Door" Policy)**

* **No Game Passport Required:** Users are **NOT** required to have a verified Game ID (e.g., Riot ID, Steam ID) to create or own a team.  
* **Management vs. Combat:** Only users occupying a "Player" or "Substitute" slot require a Game Passport. Owners, Managers, and Coaches do not.  
* **Naming Conventions:** Team names must not be offensive, political, or infringe on existing trademarks. DeltaCrown reserves the right to rename teams that violate this policy.

### **2.2. Multi-Team Ownership**

* **For Users (Independent):** A user may create only **one** Independent Team per game title.  
* **For Organizations:** An Organization may own **multiple** teams per game title (e.g., "Syntax Main" and "Syntax Academy"), provided they maintain distinct rosters.

---

## **3\. Roster Management & Integrity**

### **3.1. The "One-Team" Rule (Anti-Conflict)**

* An individual User Account may only be listed as a **Player** on **ONE** active roster per game title.  
  * *Example:* You cannot play for "Protocol V" (Valorant) and "Dhaka Killers" (Valorant) simultaneously.  
  * *Exception:* You may be a *Manager* for one team and a *Player* for another, provided there is no conflict of interest in the same tournament.

### **3.2. Roster Locks**

* **Definition:** Once a tournament bracket is generated, the team roster is **Locked**.  
* **Restriction:** No players can be added, kicked, or swapped during an active tournament run.  
* **Emergency Stand-ins:** Must be approved by Tournament Admins manually and are only permitted for medical or technical emergencies.

### **3.3. Age & Identity**

* All players must meet the minimum age requirement for the specific game (typically 13+ or 16+).  
* **Account Sharing:** Strictly Prohibited. The person playing on the account must match the Verified Identity on DeltaCrown. Violations result in a permanent ban.

## **4\. Roles & Permissions (RBAC)**

Access to team assets is determined by role.

| Role | Access Level | Game Passport? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Owner (CEO)** | Full Control (Wallet, Branding, Roster, Deletion). | ❌ No |
| **Manager** | Operational Control (Roster, Tournament Ops). Cannot Delete Team. | ❌ No |
| **Coach** | View-Only (Stats, Replays). Can trigger Scrims. | ❌ No |
| **Player** | Combat Only. Can view schedule. | ✅ **YES** |

*   
  **Role Limitation:** An "Independent Team" Owner acts as both Owner and Manager. In an "Organization," the Org is the Owner, and a Staff Member is the Manager.

---

## **5\. Financial Policy (Wallets & Payouts)**

### **5.1. Prize Pool Distribution**

* **Independent Teams:** All tournament winnings are credited directly to the **Team Owner's Personal Wallet**. Distribution to players is the Owner's responsibility.  
* **Organization Teams:** All winnings are credited to the **Organization Master Wallet**.  
  * *Smart Split:* If a "Smart Contract" is active (e.g., 90/10 split), the system will automatically distribute funds to players immediately upon winning.

### **5.2. Withdrawal Rules**

* Withdrawals are processed via local banking/mobile financial services (Bkash, Nagad).  
* **KYC Requirement:** Users must complete ID Verification to withdraw amounts exceeding 5,000 BDT.

---

## **6\. Tournament Operations (TOC)**

### **6.1. The "Active Lineup" Protocol**

* Teams must maintain an "Active Lineup" (Starters) in their Tournament Operations Center (TOC).  
* **Validation:** Registration is blocked if any member of the Active Lineup has an expired or missing Game Passport.

### **6.2. Check-In & No-Shows**

* **Check-In Window:** Teams must check in 15–30 minutes before the scheduled match time.  
* **Failure to Appear:** Missing the check-in window results in automatic Disqualification (DQ).  
* **Entry Fees:** Tournament Entry Fees are **Non-Refundable** in cases of No-Show or DQ.

---

## **7\. Organization-Specific Rules**

### **7.1. Acquisition & Transfer**

* **Ownership Transfer:** An Organization may "Acquire" an Independent Team. Upon acceptance, the Independent Owner is downgraded to "Manager," and the Organization assumes full ownership of the slot and history.  
* **Inheritance:** Teams under a verified Organization automatically inherit "Verified Squad" status.

### **7.2. Branding Enforcements**

* Teams under an Organization may use custom logos ("Sub-Brands"), but DeltaCrown reserves the right to display the Parent Organization's badge/logo alongside the team name in official broadcasts and brackets.

---

## **8\. Code of Conduct (The "Delta Standard")**

* **Zero Tolerance:** Use of cheat software, scripts, or exploiting bugs results in a **Hardware ID Ban** for the player and a **Season Suspension** for the Team.  
* **Toxicity:** Hate speech, racial slurs, or harassment in Lobby Chat or Team Chat is grounds for immediate account suspension.  
* **Match Fixing:** Any evidence of intentionally losing a match (throwing) for rank manipulation or betting fraud will result in a **Permanent Ban** for the entire Organization.
