# **📄 TEAM HUB** 

# **THE COMPETITIVE FRONT PAGE** 

**One-line Design Brief:**

**"Design a competitive landing page that makes solo players feel behind if they don't create a team."**

## **1\. Purpose of the Team HUB Page**

The Team Hub is the high-energy "Entry Portal" into the DeltaCrown ecosystem. It is designed to transform solo players into competitive entities.

* **Primary Goal:** Drive **Team Creation**. Every element on this page must lead the user toward establishing a formal competitive identity.  
* **Secondary Goals:**  
  * **Onboarding:** Convert solo players into team members through recruitment.  
  * **Visibility:** Show that the ecosystem is "alive" through real-time rankings and active challenges.  
  * **Navigation:** Act as the central routing station to specialized pages (Org Hub, Tournament Center, Rankings).  
* **Target User Types:** Solo gamers, aspiring captains, and established organization scouts.  
* **Definition of Success:** A user either **creates a team**, **joins a roster**, or **commits to a challenge** within 60 seconds of landing on the page.

**Core Mantra:** This is not a settings page or an analytics dashboard. It is a **Conversion Engine**. If a feature doesn't inspire a user to compete, it is secondary.

## **2\. Target Users & Scenarios**

The Hub must address four distinct profiles, prioritizing **creation** and **status signals** over complex management.

* **The Aspiring Founder (New Solo Player):** Needs to see that creating a team is "Fast-Track" (under 30 seconds) and unlocks the path from "Grassroots to Glory".  
* **The Mercenary (Solo looking to join):** Needs to see the **"Scouting Grounds"**—active teams with open slots that match their skill level.  
* **The Active Captain (Returning User):** Needs an **"At-a-Glance Readiness"** check.  
  * *Goal:* See if the team is "Tournament Ready" (Green/Red signal) or has a match starting soon.  
  * *Constraint:* This is a **signal**, not a control. Management actions happen on the specific Team Dashboard.  
* **The Organization CEO (Aspirational Observer):** Needs to see **"Market Signals"**—which independent teams are rising.  
  * *Goal:* Validating that the ecosystem is professional.  
  * *Constraint:* Passive viewing only. No complex acquisition tools on this page


---

## **3\. Game Context & Dynamic Scope (The "Combat Zone")**

To prevent "information overload" and ensure the page remains a conversion engine, not a directory.

* **Default State (Global):** **Curated Highlights Only.**  
  * *Strict Constraint:* Do **NOT** show deep feeds or infinite scrolls here. Show only the Top 3 "Headlines" (e.g., 1 Major Tournament, 1 Trending Team, 1 Big Transfer) to prove the platform is alive.  
* **The "Combat Zone" Filter:** A prominent UI element allowing users to select a specific title (e.g., *eFootball™ 2026* or *VALORANT*).  
* **Dynamic Contextual Changes:** When a game is selected, the Hub focuses exclusively on that title:  
  * **Rankings:** Top 5 Teams only (Preview).  
  * **Discovery:** Recruiting teams for that game only.  
  * **Competitions:** Live/Upcoming events for that game.

---

## **4\. Core Action: Create Team**

Creating a team is the "Master Key" to the DeltaCrown platform.

* **Visual Priority Rule:** The "Create Team" button must be **visible above the fold at all times**, regardless of the user's scroll position, game filter selection, or login status. It is the primary visual anchor of the page.  
* **Why it Matters:** A team is required to earn **Crown Points (CP)**, save permanent match history, and access the **Direct Invite Ecosystem** (Free entry to major events).  
* **What it Unlocks:**  
  * Access to the **Tournament Operations Center (TOC)** for one-click registration.  
  * The **Team Wallet** with automated prize splitting.  
  * A spot in the **DCRS Rankings** to earn status symbols (Badges/Tiers).  
* **Architectural Constraints:**  
  * **Independent Teams:** Users are limited to **one active independent team per game** to prevent spam.  
  * **Organization Teams:** Verified Orgs can bypass this to create "Academy" rosters.

**Secondary Action:** Include a subtle **"Learn about Team Benefits"** link (Ghost Button or Text Link) near the primary "Create Team" button.

* *Why:* Captures the "hesitant user" who isn't ready to click the big button yet.

---

## **5\. Team Definition (Platform-Specific)**

**A "Team" on DeltaCrown is the fundamental unit of competition, distinct from a casual user group.**

* **Team vs. User:**  
  * **A User is an individual account (the player).**  
  * **A Team is a competitive entity with a persistent history, ranking, and wallet. It exists independently of its members; players can join and leave, but the team's legacy (trophies, match history) remains.**  
* **Team vs. Organization:**  
  * **Independent Team: Owned by a single user (Captain/Creator). It represents 90% of the platform's initial volume.**  
  * **Organization: A business entity that owns multiple teams (departments) across different games. Organizations provide structure, funding, and branding but rely on teams to actually compete.**  
* **The Lifecycle:**  
  * **Creation: Instant (under 30 seconds), game-specific, and requires no Game ID for the owner.**  
  * **Participation: Teams enter tournaments via the Tournament Operations Center (TOC), which manages rosters and check-ins.**  
  * **Ranking: Teams earn Crown Points (CP) based on performance, which determines their Tier (Bronze to Crown).**  
  * **Persistence: A team's history and rank are permanent unless disbanded or acquired.**

## **6\. Competitive Systems Overview**

**The Hub must showcase the three pillars of competition that keep teams active.**

### **6.1 Tournaments (The Main Events)**

* **Visibility: The Hub displays "Live" and "Upcoming" tournaments for the selected game.**  
* **Action: Users can click to view details or register their team immediately via the TOC.**  
* **Motivation: Highlighting prize pools and "Tier" status (e.g., Tier S, Tier A) drives participation.**

### **6.2 Rankings (The Status Symbol)**

* **Game-Specific Leaderboards: The Hub features a snapshot of the top teams for the selected game (e.g., "Top 5 Valorant Teams").**  
* **The "Crown" Chase: Visual cues (badges, rising arrows) show movement in the ranks.**  
* **Trust Builder: "View Ranking Policy" (Small text link or Info Icon) must be visible near the leaderboard header so users understand *how* to climb.**  
* **Global Relevance: While game-specific ranks are primary, a "Global Empire Score" for Organizations adds prestige.**

### **6.3 Challenges & Bounties (The Daily Grind)**

* **Always-On Competition: When no tournaments are live, teams can issue Challenges or accept Bounties (e.g., "Scrim vs. Protocol V \- 500 BDT").**  
* **Risk/Reward: These matches contribute to team stats and potentially small CP gains, keeping the platform active 24/7.**  
* **Discovery: The Hub lists open challenges, allowing teams to find matches instantly.**

## **7\. Team Discovery Content (The "Scouting Grounds")**

**This section serves as the "Classifieds" for the ecosystem, connecting players with teams.**

* **The Feed: A dynamic list of existing teams, filtered by the selected game.**  
* **Status Indicators:**  
  * **"Recruiting": Explicitly tagged teams looking for players (e.g., "LF Duelist").**  
  * **"Active": Teams currently online or in a match.**  
  * **"New": Recently created teams looking for their first members.**  
* **Why It Exists:**  
  * **Social Proof: Seeing hundreds of active teams validates the platform's popularity.**  
  * **Recruitment: Solves the "solo player" problem by providing a direct path to joining a team.**  
  * **Ecosystem Health: A vibrant discovery feed proves that the community is alive and welcoming.**  
    

## **8\. Join Team & Recruitment Flow**

**Converting solo players into team members is critical for retention, but must remain "lightweight" on the Hub.**

* **"Open to Work" (Signal): Visual indicator that a user is looking for a team.**  
* **"Recruiting" Tags (Signal): Teams in the discovery feed are tagged with specific needs (e.g., "Need IGL").**  
* **Application System (Entry Point): A single "Apply" button. The complex flow (reviewing stats, chatting) happens off-page.**  
* **Transfer Market (Headline Ticker):**  
  * ***Constraint:*** **Signal Only. Display high-profile roster moves as a "News Ticker" or "Headline Card." Do not build a complex searchable transfer database on the Hub.**

## **9\. Fair Play & Platform Rules (Summary Level)**

**The Hub must transparently communicate the "Rules of Engagement" without overwhelming the user. These snippets set expectations immediately.**

* **The "One-Team" Rule: A user can be a Player on only ONE active roster per game title to prevent conflict of interest. Independent users are limited to owning one team per game.**  
* **Roster Locks: Teams cannot change players while a tournament bracket is active. The Hub should visualize this status (e.g., "Roster Locked" indicator).**  
* **Identity vs. Combat: Clarify that creating a team (Management) requires no Game ID, but playing in a slot (Combat) does.**  
* **Purpose: These rules prevent "smurfing" and roster churning, ensuring the "Ranking" shown on the Hub is legitimate.**

## **10\. Progression & Retention Signals**

**The Hub must answer: *"Where do I go from here?"* It visualizes the "Grassroots to Glory" pathway.**

* **Visual Hierarchy (DCRS Tiers): Display the path from Unranked → Bronze → Diamond → Crown.**  
  * ***Hook:*** **"Reach Diamond to unlock Direct Invites ($0 Entry Fees)".**  
* **The "Empire" Path: Show that successful Independent Teams can be Acquired by Organizations, turning a casual team into a paid profession.**  
* **Legacy Building: Emphasize that stats, trophies, and match history are permanent. A team is not just for one weekend; it is a long-term asset.**

## **11\. Organizations (Secondary Feature)**

**While the Hub focuses on Team Creation, it must acknowledge the "Pro Layer" to build aspiration.**

* **The "Empire Score": Display a leaderboard of top Organizations based on the aggregate performance of their sub-teams.**  
* **Acquisition Signals: If a user’s Independent Team is performing well, the Hub can show a "Scoutable" indicator, signaling they are visible to Org recruiters.**  
* **Design Note: Organizations are the destination, not the starting point. They should occupy "Premium" real estate (e.g., a "Top Orgs" sidebar) but never block the "Create Team" flow.**

## **12\. Content Priority & Emphasis**

**To prevent clutter, the UI must strictly follow this hierarchy:**

1. **Create Team (Primary Action): The "Fast-Track" button (30-second creation).**  
2. **Live Competition: Active Tournaments or Bounties (The "Now").**  
3. **Rankings & Status: Who is on top? (Social Proof).**  
4. **Recruitment (Join): "Help Wanted" ads and Open Teams.**  
5. **Discovery: Browsing the ecosystem.**  
6. **Rules & Education: "How it works" (Secondary).**  
7. **Organization Management: (Tertiary \- mostly for existing CEOs).**

## **13\. Empty States & Early-Stage Considerations**

**On "Day 1" or during quiet hours, the Hub must not look dead.**

* **No Live Tournaments?**  
  * **Fallback: Highlight Challenges & Bounties. "No tournaments live? Issue a Challenge to \[Random Team\] for 500 BDT."**  
* **Empty Rankings?**  
  * **Call to Action: "Be the first to claim the Crown. Season 1 starts now."**  
* **No Teams in Filter?**  
  * **Prompt: "No teams found for \[Game\]. Create the first one and dominate the leaderboard."**  
* **Strategy: "Empty" is an opportunity for First Mover Advantage, not a bug.**

## **14\. Design Guardrails & Scope Rules (Crucial for UX)**

**These rules prevent the Hub from becoming a cluttered dashboard.**

### **14.1 Hub Page Scope Rule**

**"The HUB surfaces signals, opportunities, and entry points. All deep management actions happen on dedicated pages."**

* **Visual Constraint: All Hub components must visually communicate "preview" status (cards, snippets, badges). No tables, complex forms, or dense data blocks are permitted.**

### **14.2 Signal vs. Action**

* **Signals (Visual Only): Rank movement (Up/Down arrows), "Recruiting" tags, "Live" badges.**  
* **Actions (Clicks): "Create Team," "Apply," "Register."**  
* ***Rule:*** **If an element requires more than one click to complete, it belongs on a detail page, not the Hub.**

### **14.3 Visual Depth Caps**

* **Rankings: Preview Only (Top 3–5 rows). User clicks "View All" for the full leaderboard.**  
* **Discovery: Scrollable Strip (Horizontal) or limited list (Vertical, max 5 items). No infinite vertical scroll that buries the footer.**  
* **Orgs: Leaderboard Snippet only.**

### **14.4 Emotional Tone & Language**

* **Tone: Competitive, Fast, and Professional.**  
* **Visual Guardrail: Terms like "Empire" and "Acquisition" are business metaphors, not fantasy RPG terms. The design should look like a Sports Exchange (ESPN/Nasdaq), not a dungeon crawler.**

### **14.5 Copy Constraints**

* **Correct: "Create Team," "Start Your Legacy," "Join a Squad."**  
* **Incorrect: "Manage Team," "Edit Roster," "Admin Panel." (These imply work, not play).**

### **14.6 User State Logic (Logged-In vs. Logged-Out)**

* **Consistency Rule: The Hub layout remains identical for logged-out users. Do not hide the "Combat Zone" or Rankings.**  
* **Interaction: Clicking "Create Team" or "Apply" simply triggers the Login/Signup Modal.**  
  * ***Why:*** **We want unauthenticated users to see exactly what they are missing ("FOMO").**

## 

## **15\. Success Criteria (UX Outcome)**

**The Hub is successful if a new user performs one of the following within 60 seconds:**

1. **Creates a Team (Independent).**  
2. **Applies to Join a "Recruiting" team.**  
3. **Registers for a Tournament or accepts a Bounty.**  
4. **Navigates to a specific Game Context (e.g., switches filter to *VALORANT*).**

## **16\. Footer & Educational Entry Points**

**To satisfy the "Researcher" persona without cluttering the main conversion flow.**

* **Placement: At the very bottom of the Hub (Pre-Footer area).**  
* **Content:**  
  * **"New to DeltaCrown?" Section.**  
  * **CTA: "Read the Team Guide" (How to create, join, and earn).**  
  * **Policy Links: "DCRS Ranking Rules," "Fair Play Policy," "Prize Money FAQ."**
