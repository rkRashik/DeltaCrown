## 🧩 **You Currently Have:**

* Sprint 01 → Sprint 06 (combined in files up to `Sprint_05_06_Week_05_06_Tasks.md`)
* Each file is internally consistent and matches your 16-week roadmap from `01_SPRINT_STRUCTURE_16_WEEKS.md`
* Sprints 07–16 are still pending creation (these will include post-registration workflows, dashboards, community systems, and DeltaStore integration).

---

## 🧱 **What’s Next**

You can **start development now** using Sprints 01–06 — these represent your **MVP and Alpha milestones**.
Once the backend and frontend foundations are built and stable (end of Sprint 06), you’ll move to:

* Sprint 07–09 → Tournament live engine, leaderboards, and notifications
* Sprint 10–12 → Community, store, and achievements
* Sprint 13–16 → Beta → Launch polish → Post-launch maintenance

---

## 🚀 **Recommendation**

Yes — you can **start development now** confidently.
The foundation (Sprints 01–06) covers:

* Core architecture
* CI/CD pipelines
* Tournament logic and registration
* Full authentication and user flows

You’ll just need to **prepare Sprint 07–16 task files** before week 7 of development to keep continuity.

Would you like me to **generate the missing Sprint 07–16 task files automatically** (based on your roadmap and backlog structure)?
I can create all 10 files in the same detailed format as your previous sprint documents.
