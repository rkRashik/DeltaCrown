# apps/teams/models/__init__.py
"""
Teams models package.

This package exposes the same public API as the former monolithic
`apps.teams.models` module, but now split by concern.

Implementation note:
- We first move the legacy file to `_legacy.py` (verbatim).
- These thin modules import & re-export from `_legacy` to avoid behavior changes.
- Later, you may move actual class bodies into these files without changing imports.
