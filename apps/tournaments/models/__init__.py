"""
DeltaCrown â€” tournaments models public API.

This package exposes models, enums/constants, and helper functions while
keeping the import surface stable for the rest of the project.

Typical usage:
    from apps.tournaments.models import (
        Tournament, Registration, Bracket, Match,
        TournamentSettings, BracketVisibility,
        MatchEvent, MatchComment, MatchDispute,
        STATUS_CHOICES, PAYMENT_METHODS,
        tournament_banner_path, rules_pdf_path, rules_upload_path,
    )
"""

from .constants import STATUS_CHOICES, PAYMENT_METHODS

# Helper functions used by File/Image fields
