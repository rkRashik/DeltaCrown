# Registration Form Dynamic Mode Fix ✅

## Problem
The registration form was not changing between solo and team modes. All tournaments showed the same form structure regardless of whether they were solo or team tournaments.

## Root Cause
The `_is_team_event()` method in registration services was checking for a non-existent `mode` field instead of using the actual `tournament_type` field.

### Original Code (BROKEN):
```python
@staticmethod
def _is_team_event(tournament) -> bool:
    """Determine if tournament is team-based"""
    settings = getattr(tournament, "settings", None)
    if settings:
        min_team_size = getattr(settings, "min_team_size", None)
        max_team_size = getattr(settings, "max_team_size", None)
        if (min_team_size and min_team_size > 1) or (max_team_size and max_team_size > 1):
            return True

    # ❌ This field doesn't exist!
    mode = getattr(tournament, "mode", "") or getattr(settings, "mode", "") if settings else ""
    if mode and any(x in str(mode).lower() for x in ["team", "squad", "5v5", "3v3", "2v2"]):
        return True

    return False
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed `_is_team_event()` Method
Updated in both service files:
- `apps/tournaments/services/registration_service.py`
- `apps/tournaments/services/registration_service_phase2.py`

**New Code:**
```python
@staticmethod
def _is_team_event(tournament) -> bool:
    """Determine if tournament is team-based"""
    # ✅ Check tournament_type field first (Phase 2 field)
    tournament_type = getattr(tournament, "tournament_type", "")
    if tournament_type and str(tournament_type).upper() in ['TEAM', 'MIXED']:
        return True
    
    # Check settings.min_team_size / max_team_size as fallback
    settings = getattr(tournament, "settings", None)
    if settings:
        min_team_size = getattr(settings, "min_team_size", None)
        max_team_size = getattr(settings, "max_team_size", None)
        if (min_team_size and min_team_size > 1) or (max_team_size and max_team_size > 1):
            return True

    return False
```

### 2. Fixed Import Errors
The registration_service_phase2.py had incorrect imports:
```python
# ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN):
from apps.tournaments.models_phase1 import (...)

# ✅ AFTER (FIXED):
from apps.tournaments.models.core.tournament_schedule import TournamentSchedule
from apps.tournaments.models.core.tournament_capacity import TournamentCapacity
from apps.tournaments.models.core.tournament_finance import TournamentFinance
from apps.tournaments.models.tournament_media import TournamentMedia
from apps.tournaments.models.tournament_rules import TournamentRules
from apps.tournaments.models.tournament_archive import TournamentArchive
```

### 3. Updated Tournament Types
Created and ran `fix_tournament_types.py` to set correct tournament_type for all test tournaments:

**Solo Tournaments (1v1 games):**
- ✅ Test eFootball Tournament → `SOLO`
- ✅ Test FC 26 Championship → `SOLO`

**Team Tournaments (Squad games):**
- ✅ Test VALORANT Championship 2025 → `TEAM` (5-7 players)
- ✅ Test CS2 Open Tournament → `TEAM` (5-7 players)
- ✅ Test Dota 2 Solo Championship → `TEAM` (5-7 players)
- ✅ Test MLBB Mobile Cup → `TEAM` (5-7 players)
- ✅ Test PUBG Battle Royale → `TEAM` (4 players)
- ✅ Test Free Fire Solo League → `TEAM` (4 players)

### 4. Created/Updated Tournament Settings
For all team tournaments, created TournamentSettings with proper `min_team_size` and `max_team_size` values.

## Verification Results

All tournaments now correctly detected:
```
Test CS2 Open Tournament          → TEAM ✅ (5-7 players)
Test Dota 2 Solo Championship     → TEAM ✅ (5-7 players)
Test eFootball Tournament         → SOLO ✅
Test FC 26 Championship           → SOLO ✅
Test Free Fire Solo League        → TEAM ✅ (4 players)
Test MLBB Mobile Cup              → TEAM ✅ (5-7 players)
Test PUBG Battle Royale           → TEAM ✅ (4 players)
Test VALORANT Championship 2025   → TEAM ✅ (5-7 players)
```
