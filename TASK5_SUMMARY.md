TeamRankingCalculator.recalculate_all_teams()
```

### Add Custom Point Source
```python
# In ranking_calculator.py
def _calculate_custom_points(self):
    """Add custom point calculation logic."""
    # Example: Social media engagement bonus
    followers = self.team.followers_count
    return followers // 100  # 1 point per 100 followers
```

# In tournament_integration.py
def validate_roster(self):
    """Override to add custom validation."""
    result = super().validate_roster()
    
    # Add custom rule
    if self.team.created_at > timezone.now() - timedelta(days=30):
        result['errors'].append("Team must be at least 30 days old")
    
    return result
