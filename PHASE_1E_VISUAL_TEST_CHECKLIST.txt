# Failure Scenarios

If buttons still invisible:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify tokens.css loaded: Network tab → filter "tokens.css" → status 200
4. Verify CSS applied: DevTools → Elements → .bg-z-gold → Shows computed styles

If custom classes not working:
1. Check staticfiles/siteui/css/tokens.css has utility classes (lines 232-273)
2. Run: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear`
3. Restart Django development server
4. Hard refresh browser
