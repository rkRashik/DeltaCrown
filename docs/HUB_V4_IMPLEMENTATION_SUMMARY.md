## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

**Check:**
```powershell
ls static/img/game_cards/

```

**If missing:**
1. Add the image files to `static/img/game_cards/`
2. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
3. Refresh browser

### Issue: Tournament banner images not showing
**Check:**
1. Does Tournament model have `banner_image` field?
