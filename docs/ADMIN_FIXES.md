# Admin Interface Fixes - Duplicate Fields & CKEditor Issues

## Issues Resolved

### ðŸ”§ **Duplicate Fields Problem - FIXED**

**Problem**: Tournament admins were seeing duplicate team size and substitute settings:
- **Registration Policy Section**: `team_size_min`, `team_size_max`, `allow_substitutes`  
- **Entry & Prize Section**: `min_team_size`, `max_team_size`, `allow_substitutes`

**Solution**: 
âœ… **Consolidated team settings** into the Registration Policy section only  
âœ… **Removed duplicates** from TournamentSettings inline  
âœ… **Renamed sections** for clarity:
   - "Team Registration Settings" - handles team size validation
   - "Prize Pool & Entry Fee" - handles financial settings only

**Result**: Clean, non-confusing admin interface with single source of truth for team settings.

### ðŸŽ¨ **CKEditor Visibility Issues - FIXED**

**Problems**:
- Text not clearly visible while typing in "Short description" 
- "Additional rules" field text hard to read
- Poor contrast and small editor size

**Solutions Applied**:
âœ… **Improved visibility**: Stronger borders, better contrast  
âœ… **Enhanced readability**: Larger font (14px), better line-height (1.6)  
âœ… **Bigger editor**: Increased min-height to 200px  
âœ… **Better focus states**: Clear blue focus ring  
âœ… **Dark mode support**: Proper colors for dark themes  
âœ… **Font consistency**: System fonts for better readability

**CSS Changes** (`static/admin/css/ckeditor5_fix.css`):
- Added `!important` rules to ensure visibility
- Improved placeholder text styling
- Enhanced toolbar appearance
- Better content typography
