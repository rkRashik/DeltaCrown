### Why It's Useful

**Perfect for recurring tournaments:**
- Weekly tournaments with same settings
- Monthly championships with similar structure
- Seasonal events with consistent rules

**Saves time:**
- No need to manually copy 20+ fields
- No risk of forgetting a setting
- Instant setup with one click

### How to Use

#### Method 1: Clone Single Tournament
1. Go to **Tournaments** list in admin
2. Find the tournament you want to clone
3. **Check the box** next to it
4. Select **"📋 Clone/Copy selected tournaments"** from Actions dropdown
5. Click **"Go"**
6. ✅ Done! A copy is created with status = DRAFT

## Feature 2: Archive System (COMPLETED Status)

### What It Does

When a tournament status is changed to **COMPLETED**:
- 🔒 **All fields become read-only** (archived)
- 🚫 **Cannot be edited** (data preservation)
- 🚫 **Cannot be deleted** (permanent record)
- ⚠️ **Visual warning** shown in admin
- ✅ **Can still view** all data
- 📋 **Can clone** to create new tournament

### Why It's Important

**Data Integrity:**
- Prevents accidental changes to historical data
- Preserves results permanently
- Maintains accurate records for legal/audit purposes

**Compliance:**
- Tournament results are legally binding
- Prize winners must be recorded accurately
- Audit trail for financial reporting

**Safety:**
- No accidental edits
- No accidental deletion
- Historical data protected

### How It Works

#### Automatic Archive
When you complete a tournament:
```
Tournament status changed to COMPLETED
    ↓
Automatically archived
    ↓
All fields become readonly
    ↓
Delete button disabled
```

#### Visual Indicators

**In Tournament List:**
- 🟥 Red badge: **COMPLETED**
- Indicates archived status

**In Tournament Edit Page:**
- 🔒 **Yellow warning banner** at top
- Message: "ARCHIVED TOURNAMENT - Read-only mode"
- All input fields **disabled**

| Export data | ✅ Yes |

## Feature 3: Status in Schedule Section

### What Changed

**Before:**
```
Basics
├── Name
├── Slug
├── Game
├── Status  ← Was here
└── Description

Schedule
├── Start / End dates
└── Registration dates
```

**After:**
```
Basics
├── Name
├── Slug
├── Game
└── Description

Schedule & Status  ← Better organization
├── Status  ← Now here with dates
├── Start / End dates
├── Registration dates
└── Slot size
```

### Why Better

**Logical Grouping:**
- Status controls timing (PUBLISHED opens registration)
- Dates define schedule
- All time-related fields together

**Admin Workflow:**
- See status and dates in same section
- Easier to understand tournament lifecycle
- Clear relationship between status and timing
