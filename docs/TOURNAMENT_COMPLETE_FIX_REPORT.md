## 📋 Complete Changelist

### 1. Tournament Model (`apps/tournaments/models/tournament.py`)

#### Added Validation
```python
def clean(self):
    # Validates:
    - Registration dates (open < close)
    - Tournament dates (start < end)  
    - Registration closes before tournament starts
    - Slot size >= 2 if set
```

#### Improved Properties
```python
@property
def entry_fee(self):
    # Clear precedence: model field → settings fallback
    # Returns Decimal or None
    
@property  
def prize_pool(self):
    # Clear precedence: model field → settings fallback
    # Returns Integer or None
```

#### Enhanced Status Field
```python
status = models.CharField(
    help_text="Tournament lifecycle status. DRAFT=hidden, PUBLISHED=visible, RUNNING=active, COMPLETED=finished"
)
```

---

### 2. Valorant Config (`apps/game_valorant/models.py`)

#### Added Game Field Validation
```python
def clean(self):
    # Prevents adding Valorant config to non-Valorant tournament
    if self.tournament.game != 'valorant':
        raise ValidationError("Cannot add Valorant config to {game} tournament")
```

---

### 3. eFootball Config (`apps/game_efootball/models.py`)

#### Added Game Field Validation
```python
def clean(self):
    # Prevents adding eFootball config to non-eFootball tournament
    if self.tournament.game != 'efootball':
        raise ValidationError("Cannot add eFootball config to {game} tournament")
```

---

### 4. Admin Interface (`apps/tournaments/admin/tournaments/admin.py`)

#### Enhanced Status Display
```python
@admin.display(description="Status")
def status_column(self, obj):
    # Color-coded badges:
    # DRAFT = Gray, PUBLISHED = Blue, RUNNING = Green, COMPLETED = Red
    return mark_safe(f'<span style="...color-badge...">{status}</span>')
```

#### Added Bulk Actions
```python
actions = (
    "action_publish_tournaments",      # 🔵 Bulk publish
    "action_start_tournaments",        # 🟢 Bulk start
    "action_complete_tournaments",     # 🔴 Bulk complete
    "action_reset_to_draft",           # ⚙️ Bulk reset
    # ... existing actions ...
)
```

---

### 5. Admin Actions (`apps/tournaments/admin/tournaments/mixins.py`)

#### Implemented 4 New Bulk Actions

**1. Publish Tournaments**
```python
@admin.action(description="🔵 Publish selected tournaments")
def action_publish_tournaments(self, request, queryset):
    # Changes DRAFT → PUBLISHED
    # Makes visible to public
    # Sends notifications
    # Shows success/error messages
```

**2. Start Tournaments**
```python
@admin.action(description="🟢 Start selected tournaments")
def action_start_tournaments(self, request, queryset):
    # Changes PUBLISHED → RUNNING
    # Validates: won't start DRAFT
    # Checks registrations
    # Closes registration
    # Sends notifications
```

**3. Complete Tournaments**
```python
@admin.action(description="🔴 Complete selected tournaments")
def action_complete_tournaments(self, request, queryset):
    # Changes RUNNING → COMPLETED
    # Validates: won't complete un-started
    # Finalizes results
    # Sends notifications
```

**4. Reset to DRAFT**
```python
@admin.action(description="⚙️ Reset to DRAFT status")
def action_reset_to_draft(self, request, queryset):
    # Emergency reset
    # Any status → DRAFT
    # Hides from public
    # Shows warning
```

---

### 6. Registration Forms (`apps/tournaments/forms_registration.py`)

#### Conditional Payment Fields
```python
def _add_payment_fields(self):
    # Only adds payment fields if entry_fee > 0
    # Fields become REQUIRED when shown
    # Cleaner forms for free tournaments
```

#### Enhanced Validation
```python
def _validate_tournament_slots(self):
    # Checks current registrations vs slot_size
    # Clear error: "Tournament is full! (X/Y slots taken)"
    # Prevents over-registration
```

## 🎯 Understanding the Status System

### The Four States

| Status | Database Value | Description | Public Visible? | Registration Open? |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **DRAFT** | `DRAFT` | Tournament being setup | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **PUBLISHED** | `PUBLISHED` | Ready for registrations | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes* |
| **RUNNING** | `RUNNING` | Tournament in progress | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **COMPLETED** | `COMPLETED` | Tournament finished | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

*Registration also depends on reg_open_at/reg_close_at dates

### Status Workflow

```
┌─────────┐
│  DRAFT  │ ← Initial state when tournament created
└────┬────┘
     │ Admin clicks "Publish" or uses bulk action
     ▼
┌───────────┐
│ PUBLISHED │ ← Tournament visible, accepting registrations
└─────┬─────┘
      │ Admin clicks "Start" or uses bulk action
      ▼
┌──────────┐
│ RUNNING  │ ← Matches in progress, registration closed
└────┬─────┘
     │ Admin clicks "Complete" or uses bulk action
     ▼
┌────────────┐
│ COMPLETED  │ ← Results finalized, tournament archived
└────────────┘
```

### Admin Controls

#### Method 1: Individual Edit
1. Open tournament in admin
2. Change "Status" dropdown
3. Save

#### Method 2: Bulk Actions (NEW!)
1. Go to tournament list
2. Select tournaments (checkboxes)
3. Choose action:
   - 🔵 Publish selected tournaments
   - 🟢 Start selected tournaments
   - 🔴 Complete selected tournaments
   - ⚙️ Reset to DRAFT status
4. Click "Go"

## 🔍 Validation Rules

### Tournament Model

✅ **Schedule Validation**:
```
reg_open_at < reg_close_at < start_at < end_at
```

✅ **Slot Validation**:
```
slot_size >= 2 (if set)
slot_size = None (no limit) is allowed
```

### Game Configs

✅ **Valorant Config**:
```
tournament.game must be "valorant"
No conflicting efootball_config allowed
```

✅ **eFootball Config**:
```
tournament.game must be "efootball"
No conflicting valorant_config allowed
```

### Registration Forms

✅ **Slot Availability**:
```
current_registrations < slot_size
Shows: "Tournament is full! (X/Y slots taken)"
```

✅ **Payment Fields**:
```
if entry_fee > 0:
    payment_method = required
    payer_account_number = required
    payment_reference = required
else:
    # Fields not shown
```

#### Managing Multiple Tournaments

1. **Go to Tournament List**

2. **Filter By Status**:
   - Use filter sidebar
   - Select "PUBLISHED" to see active
   - Select "RUNNING" to see ongoing

3. **Bulk Publish**:
   - Check boxes next to 5 DRAFT tournaments
   - Action dropdown → "🔵 Publish selected tournaments"
   - Click "Go"
   - All 5 now PUBLISHED!

4. **Starting Tournament Day**:
   - Filter to PUBLISHED tournaments
   - Check the one starting today
   - Action → "🟢 Start selected tournaments"
   - Registration closes automatically

5. **After Tournament Ends**:
   - Filter to RUNNING tournaments  
   - Check the finished one

### Common Tasks

**Q: How do I make a tournament visible?**
A: Change status from DRAFT to PUBLISHED (or use bulk action)

**Q: How do I close registration?**
A: Change status to RUNNING (or wait for reg_close_at date)

**Q: Can I un-publish a tournament?**
A: Yes! Use "⚙️ Reset to DRAFT status" action (careful, hides from public)

**Q: What if I set wrong dates?**
A: Edit tournament, fix dates, save. Validation will catch mistakes.

**Q: Can I have both Valorant and eFootball config?**
A: No, validation prevents this. Tournament must be one game type.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't publish tournament

**Symptoms**: Get error when changing to PUBLISHED

**Check**:
1. Are dates set correctly? (open < close < start < end)
2. Is slot_size valid? (>= 2 or None)
3. Is game config matching? (Valorant tournament has Valorant config)

**Fix**: Edit tournament, fix validation errors, try again

---

### Issue: Bulk action not working

**Symptoms**: Action runs but tournaments not changed

**Check**:
1. Are tournaments in correct initial state?
2. Check admin messages for warnings
3. Verify permissions (organizer groups)

**Fix**: Review warnings, fix issues, try again

---

### Issue: Payment fields not showing

**Symptoms**: Registration form missing payment fields

**Check**:
1. Is entry_fee > 0?
2. Is entry_fee_bdt field set in model?

**Fix**: Edit tournament, set entry_fee_bdt to amount, save

---

### Issue: Registration says "full"

**Symptoms**: Can't register, says tournament full

**Check**:
1. What is slot_size?
2. How many current registrations?
3. Count confirmed vs. total

**Fix**: 
- If legitimately full: Increase slot_size
- If not full: Check registration count logic

---
