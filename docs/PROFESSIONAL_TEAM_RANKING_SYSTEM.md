    qs = qs.annotate(
        memberships_count=Count("memberships"),
        achievements_count=Count("achievements"),
        tournament_wins=Count("achievements", filter=Q(achievements__placement="WINNER")),
        total_tournament_points=Coalesce(Sum(tournament_point_cases), Value(0))
    )
    return qs

# Power ranking algorithm
def _calculate_team_power_rank(team):
    """Multi-factor ranking: tournaments + activity + members + verification"""
    base_score = 1000
    member_bonus = min(team.members_count * 50, 400)
    activity_bonus = calculate_activity_bonus(team)
    verified_bonus = 300 if team.is_verified else 0
