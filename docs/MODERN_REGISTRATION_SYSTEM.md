## 🎯 Business Rules & Validations

### Core Constraints

1. **One Team Per Game Rule**
   - Users can only belong to ONE active team per game
   - Enforced at database level via unique constraint
   - Prevents conflicting registrations

2. **Captain Authority**
   - Only team captains can register teams
   - Non-captains must request approval
   - Approval requests expire with tournament registration

3. **No Duplicate Registrations**
   - User can't register twice for same tournament (solo)
   - Team can't register twice for same tournament
   - DB constraints enforce uniqueness

4. **Slot Management**
   - Tournament slot capacity checked in real-time
   - Registrations blocked when full
   - Waitlist option for full tournaments

5. **Payment Verification**
   - Entry fee tournaments require payment proof
   - Admin verification required before confirmation
   - Payment status tracked separately

6. **Profile Completeness**
   - Required fields validated before submission
   - Game-specific fields enforced dynamically
   - Phone number format validation (BD mobile)

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### New Models

```python
class RegistrationDraft(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    tournament = models.ForeignKey(Tournament, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    step = models.IntegerField(default=1)
    data = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    expires_at = models.DateTimeField()  # 24 hours from creation
```

        Returns complete context for registration button and form
        """

        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def auto_fill_team_data(team):
        """Extract team data for auto-fill"""
        pass
```

#### ApprovalService
```python
class ApprovalService:
    @staticmethod
    def create_request(requester, tournament, team, message):
        """Create captain approval request"""
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def approve_request(request, captain, response_message):
        """Approve and trigger registration"""
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def reject_request(request, captain, response_message):
        """Reject request and notify requester"""
        pass
