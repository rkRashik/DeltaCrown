# Tournament System Comprehensive Audit & Fixes

## 🔍 System Overview

The DeltaCrown tournament system consists of:
1. **Tournament Model** - Core tournament data
2. **Tournament Status** - Lifecycle management (DRAFT → PUBLISHED → RUNNING → COMPLETED)
3. **Game-Specific Configs** - Valorant & eFootball configurations
4. **Tournament Settings** - Shared configuration across games
5. **Registration Forms** - Dynamic forms based on game/settings
6. **Admin Interface** - Tournament management interface

---

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. **Status Field Confusion**
**Problem**: Tournament has TWO status-like systems:
- `tournament.status` (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, RUNNING, COMPLETED) - Admin-controlled
- `tournament.state` (State Machine) - Auto-calculated based on time/capacity

**Impact**: Confusing for admins, inconsistent behavior

### 2. **Dead/Corrupted Code**
- ❌ Old field references (`entry_fee` vs `entry_fee_bdt`)
- ❌ Duplicate schedule fields (model vs settings)
- ❌ Inconsistent game config checks
- ❌ Missing slot validation in forms

### 3. **Missing Admin Controls**
- ❌ No bulk status change actions
- ❌ No status transition validation
- ❌ Status changes don't trigger notifications
- ❌ No visual status indicators

### 4. **Model Inconsistencies**
- ⚠️ Schedule fields duplicated between Tournament and TournamentSettings
- ⚠️ entry_fee_bdt vs entry_fee confusion
- ⚠️ Game configs don't validate game field match

### 5. **Form Issues**
- ⚠️ Slot validation exists but not comprehensive
- ⚠️ Dynamic field generation is complex
- ⚠️ Payment fields always shown (even when no fee)

## 📋 Tournament Status System

### Status Values

| Status | Description | Who Sets It | When |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **DRAFT** | Not visible to public | Admin | Tournament created |
| **PUBLISHED** | Visible, registration open | Admin | Ready to accept registrations |
| **RUNNING** | Tournament in progress | Admin | Tournament started |
| **COMPLETED** | Tournament finished | Admin | Tournament concluded |

### Status Transitions

```
DRAFT ──────→ PUBLISHED ──────→ RUNNING ──────→ COMPLETED
   ↑              ↓                                    │
   └──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
        (Admin can move back to DRAFT if needed)
```

### Admin Control Points

1. **Create Tournament**: Status = DRAFT (default)
2. **Publish Tournament**: Change to PUBLISHED (makes visible, opens registration)
3. **Start Tournament**: Change to RUNNING (closes registration, starts matches)
4. **Complete Tournament**: Change to COMPLETED (archives tournament)

### Automatic Behaviors

When status changes:
- **DRAFT → PUBLISHED**: Tournament appears on public hub
- **PUBLISHED → RUNNING**: Registration closes automatically
- **RUNNING → COMPLETED**: Results finalized, coins awarded
