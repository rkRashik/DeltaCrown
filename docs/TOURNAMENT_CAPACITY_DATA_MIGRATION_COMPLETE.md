## 📁 Files Created

### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis
**File:** `scripts/analyze_capacity_migration.py` (203 lines)

**Purpose:** Analyze existing data before migration

**Output:**
- Identified 3 tournaments needing migration
- Detected 2 tournaments without capacity data
- No issues or conflicts found
- Ready for migration

### 2. Data Migration
**File:** `apps/tournaments/migrations/0034_migrate_capacity_data.py` (150 lines)

**Features:**
- Non-destructive (preserves original fields)
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Reversible (can rollback cleanly)
- Game-aware team size derivation
- Comprehensive logging

**Migration Logic:**
```python
# For each tournament with slot_size:
capacity = TournamentCapacity.objects.create(
    tournament=tournament,
    slot_size=tournament.slot_size,
    max_teams=tournament.slot_size,
    min_team_size=get_game_min_size(tournament.game),
    max_team_size=get_game_max_size(tournament.game),
    registration_mode='open',
    waitlist_enabled=True,
    current_registrations=0
)
```

### 3. Post-Migration Verification
**File:** `scripts/verify_capacity_migration.py` (227 lines)

**Checks:**
- TournamentCapacity exists for all tournaments
- Data values match source data
- Relationships work correctly
- Computed properties functional
- No data corruption

### 4. Helper Utilities
**File:** `apps/tournaments/utils/capacity_helpers.py` (400+ lines)

**Functions:** 13 helper functions
- 3-tier fallback system
- Backward compatibility
- Query optimization
- Template context helpers

---

## 🔧 Helper Functions Available

### Basic Access
```python
from apps.tournaments.utils.capacity_helpers import (
    get_capacity_field,
    is_tournament_full,
    get_available_slots,
    can_accept_registrations,
)

# Get any capacity field with fallback
slot_size = get_capacity_field(tournament, 'slot_size', 16)

# Check capacity status
if is_tournament_full(tournament):
    print("Tournament is full!")

# Get available slots
slots = get_available_slots(tournament)
print(f"{slots} slots remaining")

# Check if accepting registrations
if can_accept_registrations(tournament):
    # Show registration button
```

### Team Validation
```python
from apps.tournaments.utils.capacity_helpers import validate_team_size

# Validate team size
is_valid, message = validate_team_size(tournament, 5)
if not is_valid:
    return JsonResponse({'error': message}, status=400)
```

### Registration Management
```python
from apps.tournaments.utils.capacity_helpers import (
    increment_tournament_registrations,
    decrement_tournament_registrations,
    refresh_tournament_capacity,
)

# On registration approval
increment_tournament_registrations(tournament)

# On registration cancellation
decrement_tournament_registrations(tournament)

# Sync with database
actual_count = refresh_tournament_capacity(tournament)
```

### Query Optimization
```python
from apps.tournaments.utils.capacity_helpers import optimize_queryset_for_capacity

# Prevent N+1 queries
tournaments = Tournament.objects.filter(status='PUBLISHED')
tournaments = optimize_queryset_for_capacity(tournaments)

# Now accessing tournament.capacity won't cause extra queries
for t in tournaments:
    print(t.capacity.available_slots)  # No additional query!
```

### Template Context
```python
from apps.tournaments.utils.capacity_helpers import get_capacity_context

def tournament_detail(request, slug):
    tournament = get_object_or_404(Tournament, slug=slug)
    context = get_capacity_context(tournament)
    # context now includes: slot_size, max_teams, is_full, available_slots, etc.
    return render(request, 'tournament.html', context)
```
