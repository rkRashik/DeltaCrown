# URL Fix Summary - Professional Team Ranking System

## Issue Description
The professional team ranking page was throwing a `NoReverseMatch` error:
```
Reverse for 'request_join' not found. 'request_join' is not a valid view function or pattern name.
```

## Root Cause
The template `templates/teams/ranking_list.html` was referencing a URL pattern `teams:request_join` that doesn't exist in the URL configuration.

## Solution
Updated the template to use the correct URL pattern name:

**Before (Incorrect):**
```html
<a href="{% url 'teams:request_join' team.slug %}" class="action-btn join-btn" title="Request to Join">
```

**After (Fixed):**
```html
<a href="{% url 'teams:join' team.slug %}" class="action-btn join-btn" title="Request to Join">
```

## URL Pattern Reference
The correct URL patterns for team joining functionality:
- `teams:join` → `/teams/<slug>/join/` (Request to join a team)
- `teams:detail` → `/teams/<slug>/` (View team details)
- `teams:manage` → `/teams/<slug>/manage/` (Manage team - Captain only)

## Verification
All functionality now works correctly:
✅ Base ranking page loads successfully
✅ Search and filtering work properly  
✅ Pagination functions correctly
✅ Game filters operate as expected
✅ Sorting mechanisms work
✅ Join team buttons use correct URLs
✅ Template renders without errors
