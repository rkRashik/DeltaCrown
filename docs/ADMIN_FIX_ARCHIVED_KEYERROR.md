# üîß Admin Fix: Archived Tournament KeyError

## Issue

**Error:** `KeyError at /admin/tournaments/tournament/1/change/`
```
"Key 'slug' not found in 'TournamentForm'. Choices are: ."
```

**When it occurs:**
- Opening a COMPLETED (archived) tournament in Django admin
- The admin tries to render fields that aren't in the form

## Root Cause

When we implemented the archive system in Phase 7, we made all fields readonly for COMPLETED tournaments by adding them to `get_readonly_fields()`. However, this caused a conflict:

1. **Django's behavior:** When a field is marked readonly, Django doesn't include it in the form object
2. **Fieldsets issue:** The fieldsets configuration still referenced fields like `slug`, `name`, etc.
3. **Template rendering:** The admin template tried to access `form['slug']`, but the form was essentially empty

**The conflict:**
```python
# Fields in fieldsets
fieldsets = [
    ("Basics", {"fields": ["name", "slug", "game"]}),  # ‚Üê Expects form['slug']
    ...
]

# Fields marked readonly
readonly_fields = ["name", "slug", "game", ...]  # ‚Üê Removes from form

# Result: form['slug'] doesn't exist ‚Üí KeyError
```

## Solution

Instead of just marking fields as readonly, we now use **both** `get_readonly_fields()` AND `get_fields()`:

### 1. `get_readonly_fields()` - Marks fields as readonly
```python
def get_readonly_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    """Make all fields readonly for COMPLETED tournaments (archived)."""
    readonly = list(super().get_readonly_fields(request, obj))
    
    if obj and obj.status == 'COMPLETED':
        # Get all model fields except auto-generated ones
        all_fields = [f.name for f in obj._meta.fields if f.name not in ['id']]
        readonly = list(set(readonly + all_fields))
        
    return readonly
```

### 2. `get_fields()` - Explicitly lists fields to display
```python
def get_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    """For archived tournaments, return all fields to display."""
    if obj and obj.status == 'COMPLETED':
        # Return all model fields for display
        all_fields = [f.name for f in obj._meta.fields if f.name not in ['id']]
        # Add readonly-only link fields
        link_fields = [
            "link_export_bracket", 
            "link_force_regenerate", 
            "bracket_json_preview",
            ...
        ]
        return all_fields + link_fields
    
    # For non-archived, return None to use fieldsets
    return None
```

### 3. `get_fieldsets()` - Simplified for archived tournaments
```python
def get_fieldsets(self, request, obj=None):
    # For archived tournaments, use simplified fieldset
    if obj and obj.status == 'COMPLETED':
        all_fields = [...]  # Collect all fields
        
        return ((
            "üîí Archived Tournament (Read-Only)", 
            {
                "fields": tuple(all_fields),
                "description": "This tournament is COMPLETED and archived. All fields are read-only."
            }
        ),)
    
    # Normal fieldsets for editable tournaments
    return (...)
```

### 4. `get_prepopulated_fields()` - **THE CRITICAL FIX!** ‚ö°

```python
def get_prepopulated_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    # No prepopulated fields for archived tournaments (all fields readonly)
    if obj and obj.status == 'COMPLETED':
        return {}
    return {"slug": ("name",)} if "slug" in _present_fields(Tournament) else {}
```

**This was the root cause of the KeyError!** 

Django's prepopulated fields feature sets up JavaScript to auto-fill the `slug` field from the `name` field. When Django tries to configure this, it accesses `form['slug']` to attach the JavaScript. But for archived tournaments:
- All fields are readonly
- Fields are not in the form object
- `form['slug']` doesn't exist
- Result: `KeyError: "Key 'slug' not found in 'TournamentForm'"`

By returning an empty dict for archived tournaments, we prevent Django from trying to set up prepopulation for fields that don't exist in the form.

## How It Works Now

### For Normal (Non-Archived) Tournaments:
1. `get_fields()` returns `None` ‚Üí Django uses fieldsets
2. Fieldsets organize fields into sections (Basics, Schedule, etc.)
3. Only specific fields marked as readonly (links, metadata)
4. Form includes all editable fields

### For Archived (COMPLETED) Tournaments:
1. `get_fields()` returns explicit field list ‚Üí Django ignores fieldsets
2. All model fields + link fields listed explicitly
3. `get_readonly_fields()` marks ALL fields as readonly
4. `get_fieldsets()` provides single simplified section
5. Form doesn't need the fields (they're readonly-rendered separately)

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No KeyError:** Fields are properly defined in both places  
‚úÖ **Clean UI:** Archived tournaments show simplified single-section layout  
‚úÖ **Consistent:** All data displayed, all fields protected  
‚úÖ **Maintainable:** Changes to model automatically included  

## Testing

### Test Script
```bash
python scripts/test_archived_admin_fix.py
```

**Tests:**
1. ‚úÖ Readonly fields configuration for archived tournaments
2. ‚úÖ `get_fields()` returns explicit list for archived
3. ‚úÖ `get_fieldsets()` provides simplified view
4. ‚úÖ No conflicts between fields and fieldsets
5. ‚úÖ **Prepopulated fields empty for archived** ‚ö°
6. ‚úÖ Critical fields (name, slug, game, status) all present

**Specific Tournament ID 1 Test:**
```bash
python scripts/test_tournament_1_fix.py
```

**Verification:**
1. ‚úÖ Readonly fields: 23 fields marked readonly
2. ‚úÖ Explicit fields: 21 fields in get_fields() list
3. ‚úÖ Simplified fieldset: Single "üîí Archived Tournament" section
4. ‚úÖ **Prepopulated fields: {} (empty - this fixes the KeyError!)**
5. ‚úÖ Form generation: No KeyError
6. ‚úÖ Delete protection: Correctly blocked for archived

### Manual Testing
1. Start dev server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Go to tournament list: `/admin/tournaments/tournament/`
3. Select a COMPLETED tournament
4. Open it for editing
5. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Page loads without errors
   - ‚úÖ Yellow "ARCHIVED" banner shows
   - ‚úÖ All fields are readonly (grayed out)
   - ‚úÖ Single fieldset: "üîí Archived Tournament (Read-Only)"
   - ‚úÖ All data is visible
   - ‚úÖ Cannot edit or delete

## Technical Notes

### Django Admin Field Rendering

Django admin has two ways to render fields:

**Method 1: Form Fields (Editable)**
- Field is in the form object
- Rendered as input widget (text, select, etc.)
- Can be edited by user
- Accessed via `form['field_name']`

**Method 2: Readonly Display (Read-only)**
- Field NOT in form object
- Rendered as plain text/HTML
- Cannot be edited
- Accessed via model instance directly

**The Problem:** When we added fields to `readonly_fields`, Django switched from Method 1 to Method 2, but the template/fieldsets still expected Method 1 access.

**The Solution:** By using `get_fields()`, we tell Django: "For archived tournaments, use Method 2 for ALL fields, here's the explicit list."

### Why Not Just Remove from Fieldsets?

We could have conditionally removed fields from fieldsets, but:
- ‚ùå More complex logic
- ‚ùå Harder to maintain
- ‚ùå Still needs proper field list

Using `get_fields()` is:
- ‚úÖ Django's recommended approach
- ‚úÖ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Automatically handles all fields
- ‚úÖ Takes precedence over fieldsets
