# Task 6 Implementation Progress - Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

## Date: October 9, 2025

## Phase 1: Database Models (‚úÖ COMPLETED)

### What Was Created:

#### 1. **Analytics Models** (`apps/teams/models/analytics.py`)
Created 4 comprehensive models for advanced analytics:

  - Tracks team performance across all games
  - Fields: total_matches, win_rate, total_points, points_history (JSON)
  - Game-specific stats support (JSON field)
  - Automatic win rate calculation
  - Streak tracking (current & best)
  - Tournament statistics
  - Database table: `teams_analytics_team_stats`

- **PlayerStats Model**
  - Individual player performance within teams
  - Fields: tournaments_played, matches_played, attendance_rate
  - MVP tracking and contribution scoring
  - Individual skill rating system
  - Game-specific performance metrics (JSON field)
  - Database table: `teams_analytics_player_stats`

- **MatchRecord Model**
  - Complete match history with rich metadata
  - Support for tournament and casual matches
  - Game-specific match data (JSON field)
  - Replay/VOD URL storage
  - Points impact tracking
  - Many-to-many relationship with players via MatchParticipation
  - Database table: `teams_analytics_match_record`

- **MatchParticipation Model**
  - Tracks individual player performance per match
  - Fields: role_played, was_starter, was_mvp

  - Database table: `teams_analytics_match_participation`

#### 2. **Database Migration** (`apps/teams/migrations/0042_*.py`)
- ‚úÖ Generated migration successfully
- ‚úÖ Applied to database
- Created 4 new tables with proper indexes
- Added 7 database indexes for performance optimization

#### 3. **Admin Interfaces** (`apps/teams/admin/analytics.py`)
Created comprehensive Django admin interfaces with:

- **TeamAnalytics Admin**
  - Color-coded win rate display (green/orange/red)
  - Streak visualization with emojis (üî• for wins, ‚ùÑÔ∏è for losses)
  - Points history table view
  - Game-specific stats JSON viewer
  - 7 organized fieldsets

- **PlayerStats Admin**
  - Attendance rate color coding
  - MVP count tracking
  - Contribution score display
  - Game-specific stats viewer
  - Player activity status

- **MatchRecord Admin**
  - Result display with icons (‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ûñ)
  - Date hierarchy navigation
  - Tournament filtering
  - Inline player participation editing
  - Replay URL management
  - Game-specific data viewer

- **MatchParticipation Admin**
  - MVP highlighting
  - Role tracking
  - Performance score display
  - Game-specific performance viewer

#### 4. **Game-Specific Schemas** (`apps/teams/analytics_schemas.py`)
Comprehensive stat schemas for 9 games:

- **Valorant**: Rounds, agents, KDA, combat score, headshots, clutches
- **CS2**: Rounds, weapons, ADR, HLTV rating, multi-kills, bomb stats
- **Dota 2**: Heroes, KDA, GPM/XPM, tower damage, Roshan kills
- **MLBB**: Heroes, KDA, savage/maniac counts, lord/turtle kills
- **PUBG**: Kills, damage, placement, survival time, chicken dinners
- **Free Fire**: Booyahs, characters, KD ratio, headshots
- **eFootball/FC26**: Goals, assists, pass accuracy, formations
- **CODM**: Game modes, KD ratio, scorestreaks, objectives

Includes:
- 27 detailed stat schemas (team/player/match for 9 games)
- Schema validation functions
- Helper functions: `get_game_schema()`, `validate_game_stats()`

### Database Changes:

```sql
-- New Tables Created:
- teams_analytics_team_stats (11 fields + JSON stats)
- teams_analytics_player_stats (13 fields + JSON stats)
- teams_analytics_match_record (18 fields + JSON data)
- teams_analytics_match_participation (6 fields + JSON performance)

-- Indexes Created (7 total):
- teams_analy_team_id_a5ad31_idx (team, -match_date)
- teams_analy_tournam_7636f8_idx (tournament, -match_date)
- teams_analy_game_55e342_idx (game, -match_date)
- teams_analy_result_f9a53e_idx (result)
- teams_analy_match_i_8dd158_idx (match, player)
- TeamAnalytics: (team, game), (win_rate), (-total_points)
- PlayerStats: (team, game), (player, game), (-contribution_score), (-mvp_count)
```

### System Verification:

‚úÖ **Django System Check**: 0 issues found
```bash
$ python manage.py check teams
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

‚úÖ **Model Imports**: All models import successfully
```python
from apps.teams.models import TeamAnalytics, PlayerStats, MatchRecord, MatchParticipation
# ‚úÖ Success - all models available
```

‚úÖ **Admin Registration**: All 4 models registered in Django admin

### File Structure:

```
apps/teams/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py (updated - exports new models)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics.py (NEW - 482 lines, 4 models)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py (updated - imports analytics admin)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics.py (NEW - 397 lines, 4 admin classes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 0042_matchparticipation_matchrecord_and_more.py (NEW)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics_schemas.py (NEW - 449 lines, 27 schemas)
```

### Code Quality:

- ‚úÖ Type hints on all methods
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive docstrings
- ‚úÖ Proper Django ORM relationships
- ‚úÖ JSON field usage for flexible game-specific data
- ‚úÖ Model methods for common operations (e.g., `update_win_rate()`, `add_match_result()`)
- ‚úÖ Proper Meta classes with indexes and constraints
- ‚úÖ Admin interfaces with color coding and formatting

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Flexible Game Support**: JSON fields allow any game to store custom stats
2. **Automatic Calculations**: Win rates, streaks, attendance calculated automatically
3. **Points History Tracking**: Full audit trail of points changes
4. **MVP System**: Track MVP awards per match and aggregate by player
5. **Tournament Integration**: Matches can link to tournaments
6. **Performance Scoring**: Individual match performance tracking
7. **Rich Admin Interface**: Color-coded displays, formatted JSON viewers

### Breaking Changes / Notes:

- Legacy `TeamStats` model renamed to `LegacyTeamStats` in exports
- New `TeamAnalytics` model uses different table name to avoid conflicts
- Both models can coexist during transition period
