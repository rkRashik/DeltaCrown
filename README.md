## 📖 The Story Behind DeltaCrown

Esports is no longer just entertainment.  
It is competition, culture, career, and community.

Yet behind the explosive growth of esports, the infrastructure remains broken.

- Tournaments disappear after they end  
- Teams lack long-term identity  
- Players grind endlessly without recognition  
- Coaches and sponsors struggle to find talent  
- Communities are scattered across platforms  
- Emerging regions lack accessible esports systems  

**DeltaCrown was created to change that.**

Not as a single-feature app.  
Not as a short-term platform.  

But as **the foundation of professional esports**.
